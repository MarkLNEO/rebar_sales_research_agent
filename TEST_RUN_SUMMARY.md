# E2E Test Run Summary
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Test Framework:** Playwright v1.47.0
**Test Suites:** 5 (56 total tests)

---

## üîç Test Execution Status

### Initial Test Run: FAILED
**Issue:** Authentication blocker preventing all tests from running

```
8 tests attempted (research.spec.ts)
8/8 FAILED - All timeouts at login
```

**Error Pattern:**
```
Test timeout of 120000ms exceeded while running "beforeEach" hook.
Error: locator.fill: Test timeout of 120000ms exceeded.
Call log:
  - waiting for getByPlaceholder('Your password')
```

---

## üêõ Root Cause Analysis

### Problem: Incorrect Login Field Selector

**What happened:**
- Test fixtures were looking for password field with `getByPlaceholder('Your password')`
- Actual login form uses `placeholder="‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢"` (8 bullet characters)
- All tests timed out after 120 seconds waiting for non-existent field

**Impact:**
- **BLOCKING:** 100% of tests unable to authenticate
- All test suites blocked (research, onboarding, preferences, profile-coach, memory)
- No tests could reach actual functionality testing

**Files Affected:**
- `/tests/fixtures.ts:63` - Login helper function

---

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### Changed:
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
await page.getByPlaceholder('Your password').fill(password);

// AFTER (correct)
await page.getByPlaceholder('‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢').fill(password);  // Password field uses bullet placeholder
```

**Commits:**
- `88ee5d2` - fix: Update test fixtures to use correct password field placeholder

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Create Test Users in Supabase
Tests require these test accounts to exist in your Supabase database:

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| `cliff.test@rebarhq.com` | (set in tests/fixtures.ts) | Account Executive |
| `sarah.test@rebarhq.com` | (set in tests/fixtures.ts) | Sales Director |

**How to create:**
1. Go to Supabase dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
2. Add users manually with email/password
3. Confirm email addresses (or disable email confirmation in Supabase Auth settings for test accounts)

### 2. Re-run Tests

After creating test users, run:

```bash
# Run all test suites in parallel
npm run test:parallel

# Or run individual suites
npm run test:research
npm run test:onboarding
npm run test:preferences
npm run test:profile-coach
npm run test:memory
```

### 3. Expected Test Coverage

Once authentication is working, tests will cover:

| Suite | Tests | Coverage |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Research** | 8 | Quick/Deep/Specific modes, streaming indicators, performance SLAs |
| **Onboarding** | 6 | Signup flow, wizard completion, validation, persistence |
| **Preferences** | 8 | Mode persistence, research count tracking, JIT prompts |
| **Profile Coach** | 17 | ICP config, buying criteria, signals, job titles |
| **Memory** | 17 | Context preservation, follow-ups, session persistence |
| **TOTAL** | **56** | Complete user journey coverage |

## üìä Test Infrastructure Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
- [x] Playwright configuration (playwright.config.ts)
- [x] Test fixtures with auth, metrics, cleanup
- [x] 5 comprehensive test suites (56 tests)
- [x] Parallel execution runner
- [x] Performance measurement utilities
- [x] Rich reporting (HTML, JSON, screenshots, videos)
- [x] Test selector fix (password field)

### ‚è≥ Pending:
- [ ] Create test users in Supabase
- [ ] First successful test run
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Tests are ready to run when:**
1. ‚úÖ Test fixtures use correct selectors (DONE)
2. ‚è≥ Test users exist in Supabase database
3. ‚è≥ Users can successfully log in to production app
4. ‚è≥ npm install & npx playwright install completed

**Expected Results:**
- All 56 tests should pass (or reveal real functional issues)
- Parallel execution should complete in ~45-60 seconds
- Performance SLA violations should be flagged
- Screenshots/videos captured for any failures

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

### Test Environment
- **Target:** Production (https://rebar-sales-research-agent.vercel.app)
- **Browser:** Chromium headless
- **Workers:** 4 parallel (local) / 2 (CI)
- **Timeout:** 120s per test
- **Retries:** 0 (local) / 1 (CI)

### Known Issues Resolved
1. ‚úÖ ts-node ESM module error (installed dependencies)
2. ‚úÖ Playwright browser not installed (ran `npx playwright install chromium`)
3. ‚úÖ Incorrect password field selector (fixed in fixtures.ts)

### Remaining Blockers
1. Test users not created in Supabase

## üìù Additional Fixes Deployed

### UI/UX Fixes (this session):
1. **Prompt instruction leak fix** (commit `c59c800`)
   - Problem: Agent was outputting "(20 words each)" in user-facing headings
   - Fix: Updated context.ts to prevent instruction leakage
   - Impact: Cleaner, more professional response headings

2. **Test suite expansion** (commit `477d9d3`)
   - Added Profile Coach tests (17 tests)
   - Added Memory & Context tests (17 tests)
   - Updated parallel runner configuration

---

## üé¨ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install
npx playwright install

# 2. Create test users in Supabase (see table above)

# 3. Run tests
npm run test:parallel

# 4. View results
npm run test:report
```
