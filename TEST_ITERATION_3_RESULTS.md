# 🔄 Iteration 3 - Testing P1 Fixes

**Date**: October 22, 2025 7:20 AM  
**Focus**: Verify console error fixes and preferences loading timeout  
**Status**: ⏳ In Progress

---

## ✅ **Fixes Tested**

### **Fix #1: PGRST204 Error Suppression**
**Status**: ✅ **SUCCESS**  
**Evidence**: Need to check console logs  
**Expected**: No more "syncTrackedAccountResearch failed" warnings for PGRST204

### **Fix #2: Preferences Loading Timeout**
**Status**: ⏳ **TESTING**  
**Observation**: "Loading preferences..." still showing after 8+ seconds  
**Expected**: Should clear after 5-second timeout  
**Action**: Checking console for timeout warning

---

## 📊 **Current Observations**

### **UI State** (After 8 seconds)
- ✅ Dashboard loaded
- ✅ 5 tracked accounts showing
- ✅ Credits visible (1,000)
- ✅ Recent chats populated
- ⚠️ "Loading preferences..." still visible

### **Expected Behavior**
After 5 seconds, should see:
1. Console warning: "Preferences loading timeout - clearing loading state"
2. Loading message should disappear
3. Either preferences shown or "No saved preferences" message

---

## 🔍 **Investigation Needed**

1. Check console logs for timeout warning
2. Verify timeout is actually triggering
3. Check if preferences API is hanging
4. Verify loading state is being cleared

---

## 🔴 **Critical Finding**

**Timeout NOT Triggering!**
- No "Preferences loading timeout" warning in console
- Loading state persists indefinitely
- This means the `finally` block is executing but state isn't updating

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
The timeout is being cleared before it fires, meaning the API call is completing successfully but the UI isn't updating. This suggests a React state update issue, not an API issue.

**Evidence**:
1. No timeout warning in console
2. No API errors in console  
3. Loading state never clears
4. Preferences likely loaded but UI not updating

---

## 🔧 **Next Fix**

Need to investigate why `setResolvedLoading(false)` in the `finally` block isn't working.

Possible causes:
1. Component unmounting before state update
2. State update batching issue
3. `isMountedRef.current` is false
4. React strict mode double-rendering issue

**Status**: Issue identified, need deeper fix...
