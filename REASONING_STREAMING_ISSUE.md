# Reasoning Streaming Issue - SOLVED

## Problem
Reasoning was NOT being streamed to the frontend, and was NOT visible in browser console network tab (SSE events).

## Root Cause
**Missing `summary: 'detailed'` parameter in reasoning configuration.**

The reasoning parameter needs BOTH `effort` AND `summary` to enable streaming:
- `effort`: Controls how much reasoning to do
- `summary`: Controls whether reasoning summaries are streamed
- Without `summary`, no reasoning events are sent

## Evidence
1. Backend has correct event handlers for reasoning (lines 136-173 in route.ts)
2. Frontend has correct display logic (lines 2796-2804 in ResearchChat.tsx)
3. But no reasoning events are being received from OpenAI

## Solution - IMPLEMENTED ✅

**Add `summary: 'detailed'` to reasoning configuration:**

```typescript
reasoning: { 
  effort: reasoningEffort,
  summary: 'detailed' as any // Required to enable reasoning summary streaming
}
```

### What This Does:
- Enables `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta` events
- Streams **reasoning summaries** (not raw reasoning)
- Works with `gpt-5-mini` (cost-effective)
- Provides transparency without excessive token usage

### Why This Works:
- **Raw reasoning** (`response.reasoning_text.delta`) is only available on full gpt-5
- **Reasoning summaries** (`response.reasoning_summary_text.delta`) work on gpt-5-mini
- Summaries are concise, user-friendly explanations of the model's thinking
- Much lower token cost than raw reasoning

### Implementation:
```typescript
// app/api/ai/chat/route.ts lines 104-109
reasoning: { 
  effort: reasoningEffort,        // 'medium' or 'high'
  summary: 'detailed' as any      // Enables summary streaming
}
```

### Event Handler (already in place):
```typescript
// app/api/ai/chat/route.ts lines 154-160
if (event.type === 'response.reasoning_summary_text.delta' && event.delta) {
  controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`data: ${JSON.stringify({
    type: 'reasoning',
    content: event.delta
  })}\n\n`));
  continue;
}
```

## Testing After Change

1. Restart dev server with cache clear: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`
2. Run research query
3. Check terminal logs for: `[chat] Event type: response.reasoning_summary_text.delta`
4. Check browser console network tab for reasoning summary events
5. Verify reasoning summaries appear in UI

## Current Status - FIXED ✅

- ✅ Added `summary: 'detailed'` to reasoning config
- ✅ Using `gpt-5-mini` (cost-effective)
- ✅ Reasoning summaries will stream
- ✅ Event handlers already in place
- ⏳ Needs dev server restart to take effect

## Expected Behavior

**Before**: No reasoning visible, long silent wait
**After**: Reasoning summaries stream in real-time, showing model's thinking process

Example reasoning summary:
```
"Searching for recent buying signals and leadership changes for Boeing..."
"Found FAA production rate increase and CFO transition..."
"Synthesizing insights into actionable recommendations..."
```
