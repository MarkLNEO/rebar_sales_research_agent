# Preference Persistence - Implementation Guide

**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented
**Date:** 2025-10-22

---

## Overview

The platform now includes **intelligent preference learning** that adapts to user behavior and explicitly asks users if they want preferences saved for future research.

> "ALL THE TIME YOU SPENT ON SETUP IS WORTH IT. Follow up questions are perpetuated going forward always."

---

## How It Works

### 1. Follow-Up Question Flow

When a user asks for more information on a topic:

**Example:**
```
User: "Tell me more about the CEO"
AI: [Provides detailed CEO information]
AI: "Would you like me to always include detailed CEO background in future company research?"
User: "Yes"
AI: [Saves preference with high confidence]
```

**Next Research:**
```
User: "Research Microsoft"
AI: [Automatically includes CEO section because preference was saved]
```

### 2. Custom Terminology Persistence

The system uses **exact terminology** from user setup:

**Setup:**
```
User sets signal_terminology = "Buying Indicators"
User sets criteria_terminology = "Deal Breakers"
```

**All Future Research:**
```
## Buying Indicators  ← Uses "Buying Indicators" not "Buying Signals"

- Leadership change detected

## Deal Breakers  ← Uses "Deal Breakers" not "Custom Criteria"

1. No SOC2 certification: Not Met
```

### 3. Entity Memory

The system tracks abbreviations and maps them:

**Example:**
```
User: "Does the company use m365?"
AI: [Remembers m365 = Microsoft 365]
AI: "Regarding their m365 stack..." ← Uses user's term, not "Microsoft 365"
```

### System Prompt Instructions

```typescript
## Preference Learning & Follow-Ups

**CRITICAL: Learn from every interaction and offer to persist user preferences**

### When User Asks Follow-Up Questions

If a user asks for MORE detail on a topic:

1. **Answer their question thoroughly**
2. **After answering, ASK if they want this in future research:**
   - "Would you like me to always include detailed CEO background in future company research?"
   - "Want me to prioritize tech stack details in all my reports going forward?"
   - "Should I make funding history a standard section from now on?"

3. **Use their exact terminology** - if they say "m365", use "m365" (not "Microsoft 365")
4. **Remember entities** - track abbreviations and map them
```

### Preference Tracking

**File:** [lib/preferences/tracker.ts](lib/preferences/tracker.ts)

The system automatically tracks:

- **Section Engagement**: Which sections users expand/collapse
- **Research Depth**: Quick vs. Deep preferences
- **Follow-Up Topics**: Topics users repeatedly ask about
- **Saved Reports**: Sections users save indicate interest

**Tracking Events:**
```typescript
type UserInteraction =
  | { type: 'section_expanded'; section: string; chatId: string }
  | { type: 'section_collapsed'; section: string; chatId: string }
  | { type: 'research_completed'; depth: 'quick' | 'deep'; agentType: string }
  | { type: 'follow_up_asked'; topic: string; chatId: string }  ← Key for this feature
  | { type: 'report_saved'; sections: string[]; chatId: string }
  | { type: 'preference_confirmed'; key: string; value: any }  ← Saves explicit confirms
```

### Custom Terminology Integration

**File:** [supabase/migrations/20250122000000_add_custom_terminology.sql](supabase/migrations/20250122000000_add_custom_terminology.sql)

**Database Schema:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_profiles
  ADD COLUMN signal_terminology TEXT DEFAULT 'Buying Signals',
  ADD COLUMN criteria_terminology TEXT DEFAULT 'Custom Criteria',
  ADD COLUMN watchlist_label TEXT DEFAULT 'Watchlist';
```

**Prompt Integration:** [app/api/lib/context.ts:376-393](app/api/lib/context.ts:376-393)
```typescript
const signalTerm = profile.signal_terminology || 'Buying Signals';
const criteriaTerm = profile.criteria_terminology || 'Custom Criteria';
const watchlistTerm = profile.watchlist_label || 'Watchlist';

prompt += `
**Required Terminology:** Always integrate the following where relevant:
- **"${signalTerm}"**
- **"${criteriaTerm}"**
- **"${watchlistTerm}"**
- These terms demonstrate attentiveness to user language
`;
```

## User Experience Examples

### Example 1: CEO Details

**Conversation 1:**
```
User: "Research Boeing"
AI: [Standard research without CEO section]

User: "Tell me more about the CEO"
AI: [Detailed CEO background]
AI: "Would you like me to always include detailed CEO background in future company research?"

User: "Yes"
AI: "Got it! I'll include CEO details in all future company research."
```

**Conversation 2 (Next Day):**
```
User: "Research Lockheed Martin"
AI: [Automatically includes CEO section]

## Leadership Overview

**CEO**: [Name]
**Tenure**: [Years]
**Background**: [Details]
```

### Example 2: Tech Stack Focus

**Conversation 1:**
```
User: "Research Stripe"
AI: [Standard research]

User: "What's their tech stack?"
AI: [Detailed tech stack analysis]
AI: "Want me to prioritize tech stack details in all my reports going forward?"

User: "Yes, always"
```

**Future Research:**
```
User: "Research Square"
AI: [Includes dedicated tech stack section automatically]

## Technology Stack

**Infrastructure**: AWS, Kubernetes
**Languages**: Python, Go, TypeScript
**Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis
```

### Example 3: Custom Terminology

**Onboarding:**
```
User sets up profile:
- signal_terminology: "Buying Indicators"
- criteria_terminology: "Must-Haves"
- watchlist_label: "Priority Accounts"
```

**All Future Research Uses These Terms:**
```
## Buying Indicators  ← Not "Buying Signals"

- New funding round announced

## Must-Haves  ← Not "Custom Criteria"

1. SOC2 certified: Met ✓
2. 100+ employees: Met ✓

## Priority Accounts  ← Not "Watchlist"

Track this company for Q1 targets
```

## Confidence Scoring

The preference tracker uses confidence scores to determine how strongly a preference should be applied:

| Source | Confidence | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Explicit Confirmation** | 95% | User said "Yes, always include this" |
| **3+ Follow-Ups Same Topic** | 60-85% | User repeatedly asks about same thing |
| **Section Expanded 3+ Times** | 70-90% | User consistently expands a section |
| **Report Saved** | 65% | User saved report with these sections |

**High confidence (>80%)** → Applied automatically to all future research
**Medium confidence (60-80%)** → Suggested but can be overridden
**Low confidence (<60%)** → Tracked but not applied

## Testing the Feature

### Manual Test Steps

1. **Start new chat**
2. **Ask for research**: "Research Salesforce"
3. **Ask follow-up**: "Tell me more about their CEO"
4. **Watch for prompt**: "Would you like me to always include detailed CEO background in future company research?"
5. **Confirm**: "Yes"
6. **New research**: "Research Microsoft"
7. **Verify**: CEO section automatically included

### Expected Behavior

- AI should ask about preference after answering follow-up
- Confirmation should be saved to `user_preferences` table
- Next research should include the section automatically
- User's custom terminology should be used throughout

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Entity Synonym Learning**: Automatically map abbreviations
   - m365 → Microsoft 365
   - SF → Salesforce
   - SFDC → Salesforce CRM

2. **Preference Dashboard**: UI to view/edit saved preferences

3. **Preference Suggestions**: "I notice you always ask about tech stack - want me to include it by default?"

4. **Context-Aware Preferences**: Different preferences for different types of companies
   - SaaS companies → Always include ARR
   - Hardware companies → Always include supply chain

---

## Key Takeaways

> "ALL THE TIME YOU SPENT ON SETUP IS WORTH IT"

1. **Setup terminology is respected** - If user says "Deal Breakers", we say "Deal Breakers"
2. **Follow-ups are perpetuated** - Ask once, included forever
3. **Explicit consent** - Always ask before persisting a preference
4. **High confidence** - Explicit confirmations get 95% confidence
5. **Immediate application** - Preferences apply to very next research
