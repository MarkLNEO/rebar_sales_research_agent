## KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Empty States Are Wasted
Every empty state should guide next action with suggestions, not just show blank space.

### 2. Bulk Operations Missing
Power users need to operate at scale. Everything should support bulk actions.

### 3. No Proactive Intelligence
System is reactive. It should suggest, predict, and guide based on patterns.

### 4. Export/Share Critical
Research value multiplies when shared. PDF, CSV, Slack, email all needed.

### 5. Templates Accelerate Adoption
Starting from scratch is hard. Templates teach best practices and speed up time-to-value.

### 6. Keyboard Shortcuts = Power Users
Mouse-only UI limits speed. Shortcuts unlock 10x productivity.

### 7. Impact Preview Builds Confidence
Users hesitate to change settings. Showing impact ("this will find 2,500 companies") removes fear.

### 8. Context Across Sessions
Conversation context should persist. "Continue where I left off" should work.
