# Next Steps: Debug Streaming Events

## Problem
Terminal shows these events but NO delta events (which carry the actual content):
- `response.created`
- `response.in_progress`
- `response.output_item.added`
- `response.output_item.done`
- `response.web_search_call.*`

**Missing:**
- `response.output_text.delta` (content)
- `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta` (reasoning)

## What I Just Did
Added logging to see the **full event structure** (not just types):

```typescript
if (!firstTokenReceived) {
  console.log('[chat] Full event structure:', JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));
}
```

## What You Need To Do

1. **Clear cache and restart:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Send a test research query** (keep it short to reduce log spam)

3. **Check terminal output** for the full event structures

4. **Look for:**
   - Where is the actual content/text being sent?
   - What field names does OpenAI use for deltas?
   - Is it `event.delta`, `event.text`, `event.content.text`, something else?
   - What are the actual event types for content deltas?

## Why This Will Help

The code expects `event.type === 'response.output_text.delta'` with `event.delta`, but OpenAI might be sending:
- Different event type names
- Different field structure (e.g., `event.content.delta`, `event.output[0].text`)
- Nested objects we're not accessing correctly

Once we see the raw event structure, I can fix the event handlers to match what OpenAI actually sends.

## Expected Outcome

You should see output like:
```json
{
  "type": "response.something.delta",
  "actual_field_name": "content here",
  "other_fields": "..."
}
```

Then I'll know exactly how to access the content and reasoning text!
