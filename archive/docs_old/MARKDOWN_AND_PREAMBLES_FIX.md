**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed  
**Build**: ‚úÖ Passing  
**Priority**: üî¥ Critical (affects all output readability)

## üêõ Problems Identified

### **Issue 1: Markdown Not Rendering**

**What Users Saw**:
```
Summary & recommendation

Quick summary: Stripe is a high-value enterprise fintech...

ICP fit score for Zscaler (0-100%)

Score: 92% ‚Äî Reasoning:
Stripe is enterprise scale...
```

**What Was Expected**:
```
## Summary & Recommendation

**Quick summary**: **Stripe** is a high-value enterprise fintech...

## ICP Fit Score: 92%

**Strong fit** ‚Äî Reasoning:
- **Enterprise scale** with $1T+ payments processed
- **Developer-centric** stack matches your product
```

**Root Cause**:
- Model was outputting plain text section names without `##` markers
- No `**bold**` formatting for key terms
- Instructions said "Use Markdown only where semantically correct" - too weak
- Model interpreted this as optional, not required

---

### **Issue 2: Tool Preambles Not Visible**

**What Users Expected**:
```
üîç Purpose: Find recent buying signals. 
   Inputs: Funding rounds, acquisitions, hiring (90 days)

[Executing web searches...]

Checking recent funding and leadership changes...
```

**What Users Saw**:
```
[Silent - no purpose statement]

Checking recent funding and leadership changes...
```

**Root Cause**:
- Instructions said "Before each significant tool call, state..."
- But model wasn't following this consistently
- No strong emphasis on importance
- Missing concrete examples of output format

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### **Fix 1: CRITICAL Markdown Requirements**

**Before** (context.ts):
```xml
<response_format>
Use Markdown **only where semantically correct**:
- `inline code` for companies, products, roles
- **bold** for emphasis on key terms
- Lists with - for bullets
- ## for section headings (not #)
</response_format>
```

**After**:
```xml
<response_format>
CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS - Your output MUST use proper markdown:

‚úÖ REQUIRED markdown elements:
- ## for ALL section headings (not plain text, not #, always ##)
- **bold** for key terms, names, companies, emphasis
- `inline code` for technical terms, products when appropriate
- Proper lists:
  * Use - for bullet lists
  * Use 1. 2. 3. for numbered lists
  * Never use "1)" format
- Blank line between sections for readability

‚úÖ Example of CORRECT formatting:
## Summary & Recommendation

**Stripe** is a high-value target with **$50B valuation** and recent **Bridge acquisition** ($1.1B)...

## ICP Fit Score: 95%

**Strong fit** because:
- Enterprise scale with **$1T+ payments processed**
- **Developer-centric** stack matches your product

‚ùå WRONG formatting (no markdown):
Summary & Recommendation
Stripe is a high-value target with $50B valuation...

‚ùå Never use:
- Raw HTML tags
- Plain text section names without ##
- "1)" style lists
- Emojis in body text (only in progress updates)

If your output doesn't have ## headings and **bold** text, it's WRONG. Fix it immediately.
</response_format>
```

**Key Changes**:
- ‚úÖ Changed "Use Markdown" ‚Üí "CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS - Your output MUST"
- ‚úÖ Changed optional feel ‚Üí "REQUIRED markdown elements"
- ‚úÖ Added side-by-side CORRECT vs WRONG examples
- ‚úÖ Made ## for ALL section headings (not just suggested)
- ‚úÖ Final enforcement: "If no ## and **, it's WRONG. Fix immediately."

### **Fix 2: CRITICAL Tool Preambles**

**Before**:
```xml
<tool_preambles>
Always provide friendly progress updates so users know what's happening.

Before each significant tool call, state in one line:
- **Purpose**: Why this action matters
- **Inputs**: What you're looking for

Example: "üîç Purpose: Find recent buying signals. Inputs: Funding news, hiring patterns, tech changes (last 90 days)"
</tool_preambles>
```

**After**:
```xml
<tool_preambles>
CRITICAL: Always provide progress updates so users see your thought process.

Before EVERY web_search or significant action, output a purpose line:
Format: "üîç Purpose: [Why this matters]. Inputs: [What you're searching for]"

Example before web searches:
"üîç Purpose: Find recent buying signals. Inputs: Funding rounds, acquisitions, hiring surge (last 90 days)"
"üîç Purpose: Identify decision makers. Inputs: CISO, Head of Security, leadership changes"
"üîç Purpose: Validate ICP fit. Inputs: Company size, tech stack, industry vertical"

During research (brief friendly updates):
"Checking recent funding and leadership changes..."
"Analyzing tech stack compatibility..."
"Cross-referencing multiple sources..."

After completion:
"‚úÖ Research complete. Here are your actionable insights..."

IMPORTANT: These purpose statements make your reasoning visible. Don't skip them.
</tool_preambles>
```

**Key Changes**:
- ‚úÖ Added "CRITICAL:" prefix
- ‚úÖ Changed "each significant" ‚Üí "EVERY web_search"
- ‚úÖ Changed "state in one line" ‚Üí "output a purpose line" (more direct)
- ‚úÖ Added 3 concrete examples (was 1)
- ‚úÖ Added IMPORTANT reminder: "make your reasoning visible. Don't skip them."
- ‚úÖ Explicit goal: "so users see your thought process"

**Before**:
```
Example good output structure (adapt as needed):
- ## Summary & Recommendation
- ## Why Now (timing + urgency)
- ## Strategic Insights
```

**After**:
```
Example good output structure (adapt as needed) - ALWAYS use markdown headings:
## Summary & Recommendation
[2-3 sentences with clear recommendation]

## Why Now (timing + urgency)

- **Recent event 2** with impact

## Strategic Insights
- **Insight 1**: Specific finding with data [Source: X, Date]
- **Insight 2**: Unexpected finding [Source: Y, Date]

## Decision Makers
- **Name** - Role - Personalization angle

## Next Actions
1. **Action 1**: Specific step with timing
2. **Action 2**: Specific step with reasoning
```

**Key Changes**:
- ‚úÖ Changed from bullet list to actual formatted example
- ‚úÖ Shows ## headings in proper context
