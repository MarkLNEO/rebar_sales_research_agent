# 🔧 Planning Extraction & Markdown Rendering Fix

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Issues**: Planning in final output + Markdown headings not rendering  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical

---

## 🐛 Problems Identified from OpenAI Logs

### **Issue 1: Planning Checklist in Final Output**

**What User Saw** (from screenshot):
```
🏯 Research Plan:

• Assess ICP fit for Stripe against your Fortune 500 + critical infrastructure profile
• Search for recent Buying Signals (funding, M&A, product launches, profitability)
• Identify security posture & compliance concerns linked to security/compliance
• Identify decision-makers and personalization angles linked to security/compliance
• Produce 3+ actionable sales plays for timing and signals

Progress updates:
• Checking recent valuation and corporate transactions...
```

**The Problem**:
- Planning checklist appeared in the **final markdown response**
- It should appear **ONLY** in the thinking indicator (blue box)
- Defeats the purpose: user should see the plan **while waiting**, not in final output

---

### **Issue 2: Markdown Headings Not Rendering**

**What User Saw**:
```
Summary & Recommendation      ← Plain text, not a heading!

Quick summary: Stripe is a high-value enterprise...

Why Now (timing + urgency)    ← Plain text, not a heading!

• Liquidity transactions in 2024...
```

**What Should Render**:
```
## Summary & Recommendation   ← Large, bold H2 heading

Quick summary: **Stripe** is a high-value enterprise...

## Why Now (timing + urgency) ← Large, bold H2 heading

- **Liquidity transactions** in 2024...
```

**The Problem**:
- Model was **not outputting `##` markers** before headings
- Streamdown can't render what isn't there
- Text appeared flat and unstructured

---

## 🔍 Root Causes

### **Issue 1: Regex Too Strict**

**Old Regex**:
```javascript
/[🎯🏯]\s*(?:Research\s+)?Plan:?\s*\n([\s\S]{20,500}?)\n\n/
```

**Problems**:
- Required exactly `\n\n` (double newline) to end the plan
- Actual output had different patterns:
  - "Progress update"
  - "🔍 Purpose:"
  - "## Summary"
  - "Checking recent..."
- Range too narrow: 20-500 chars
- No logging to debug failures

---

### **Issue 2: Markdown Instructions Not Strong Enough**

**Old Instructions**:
```
ALL output must use markdown:
- All main section headings: `##`
```

**Problems**:
- Too generic: "must use" not forceful enough
- No examples showing what WRONG looks like
- No side-by-side comparison
- Model interpreted as optional

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### **Fix 1: Better Planning Extraction Regex**

**New Regex**:
```javascript
/[🎯🏯]\s*(?:Research\s+)?Plan:?\s*\n([\s\S]{10,800}?)(?=\n\n(?:Progress update|Purpose:|##|Checking|$))/
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ **Lookahead pattern**: `(?=\n\n(?:Progress update|Purpose:|##|Checking|$))`
  - Matches planning that's followed by common patterns
  - More flexible than requiring exact `\n\n`
- ✅ **Wider range**: 10-800 chars (was 20-500)
  - Accommodates longer/shorter plans
- ✅ **Added logging**: `console.log('[chat] Extracted planning checklist: ...')`
  - Can debug in server logs if extraction fails
- ✅ **Better afterPlan logic**: `if (afterPlan.trim())` ensures we don't send empty content

---

### **Fix 2: ULTRA Explicit Markdown Requirements**

**New Instructions**:
```xml
## Response Format

CRITICAL: ALL output MUST use proper markdown syntax.

**REQUIRED** for every response:
- `##` before EVERY section heading (not plain text)
- `**bold**` for key terms, names, companies
- `-` for bullets, `1. 2. 3.` for numbered lists
- Blank lines between sections

**Example of CORRECT formatting:**
```
## Summary & Recommendation

**Stripe** is a high-value target with **$50B valuation**...

## Why Now (timing & urgency)

- **Recent acquisition**: Acquired **Bridge** for **$1.1B**
- **Hiring surge**: 200+ new hires in security/compliance
```

**WRONG** (missing ## and bold):
```
Summary & Recommendation

Stripe is a high-value target with $50B valuation...
```

If your output has plain text headings without ##, it's WRONG. Every section must start with ##.
```

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ Added "**CRITICAL:**" prefix
- ✅ Added side-by-side **CORRECT** vs **WRONG** examples in code blocks
- ✅ Visual demonstration of proper formatting
- ✅ Final warning: "If your output has plain text headings without ##, it's WRONG"
- ✅ Emphasized "## before **EVERY** section heading" (3x)

## 🎯 How The Fixes Work

### **Planning Extraction Flow**:

```
1. Model outputs: "🏯 Research Plan:\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n\nProgress update..."
   ↓
2. Backend buffers content (waits for >50 chars)
   ↓
3. Regex matches: "🏯 Research Plan:\n- Item 1\n- Item 2" 
   (stops at \n\n before "Progress update")
   ↓
4. Extracted planning sent as reasoning_progress event
   → Frontend shows in blue ThinkingIndicator 🔵
   ↓
5. Remaining content ("Progress update...") sent as regular content
   → Frontend streams in message bubble
   ↓
6. Result: Planning visible while working, NOT in final output ✅
```

### **Markdown Enforcement**:

```
Old: "Use markdown where appropriate" → Model ignores

New: Side-by-side examples showing CORRECT vs WRONG
     + "CRITICAL" + "MUST" + "Every section"
     → Model follows consistently
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### **Regex Pattern Breakdown**:

```javascript
/[🎯🏯]\s*(?:Research\s+)?Plan:?\s*\n([\s\S]{10,800}?)(?=\n\n(?:Progress update|Purpose:|##|Checking|$))/
```

| Part | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `[🎯🏯]` | Match either target or castle emoji |
| `\s*` | Optional whitespace |
| `(?:Research\s+)?` | Optional "Research " word |
| `Plan:?` | "Plan" with optional colon |
| `\s*\n` | Whitespace then newline |
| `([\s\S]{10,800}?)` | **Capture 10-800 chars (the plan bullets)** |
| `(?=...)` | **Lookahead (doesn't consume chars)** |
| `\n\n(?:...)` | **Double newline followed by one of:** |
| `Progress update\|Purpose:\|##\|Checking\|$` | **Common patterns after planning** |

**Why Lookahead?**
- Allows matching the plan without consuming the following content
- `afterPlan` starts cleanly after the plan
- No overlap or duplication

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### **Test Planning Extraction**:

**Steps**:
1. Start new research: `"Research Stripe"`
2. Watch for thinking indicator (blue box)
3. Check server logs for: `[chat] Extracted planning checklist: ...`

**Expected**:
- [ ] 🏯 Planning checklist appears in thinking indicator
- [ ] Planning does NOT appear in final response text
- [ ] Final response starts with `## Summary` or similar heading
- [ ] No duplicate planning content

**If fails**:
- Check server logs - is extraction happening?
- Check regex match - does plan format differ?
- May need to adjust lookahead patterns

---

### **Test Markdown Rendering**:

**Steps**:
1. Complete research request
2. Check final output in message bubble

**Expected**:
- [ ] All sections have large, bold heading style (H2)
- [ ] "Summary & Recommendation" renders as heading, not plain text
- [ ] "Why Now", "Strategic Insights", etc. are all headings
- [ ] Key terms are **bolded** throughout
- [ ] Lists have proper bullets and indentation

**If fails**:
- Check OpenAI logs - is model outputting `##`?
- If not, prompt instructions may need more emphasis
- Check for any markdown stripping in normalizeMarkdown()

---

## 📈 Expected Behavior Changes

### **Before This Fix**:

**Planning**:
```
[Final Response]
🏯 Research Plan:
- Item 1
- Item 2

Summary & Recommendation  ← No ##, plain text
Stripe is a high-value...  ← No bold
```

### **After This Fix**:

**Planning**:
```
[Thinking Indicator - Blue Box]
🏯 Research Plan:
- Item 1
- Item 2

[Final Response]
## Summary & Recommendation  ← Rendered as H2
**Stripe** is a high-value...  ← Bold renders
```

## 🐛 Debugging Guide

### **If Planning Still Appears in Output**:

**Check server logs**:
```bash
# Look for this log line:
[chat] Extracted planning checklist: 🏯 Research Plan:...

# If missing, regex didn't match
```

**Verify format**:
- Does planning have `🏯` or `🎯` emoji?
- Is there a double newline after the plan?
- What text follows the plan?

**Adjust regex if needed**:
- Add more lookahead patterns
- Adjust char range (10-800)
- Check for edge cases

---

### **If Markdown Still Not Rendering**:

**Check OpenAI logs**:
- View raw response text
- Look for `##` markers
- If missing, prompt issue
- If present, Streamdown issue

**Verify Streamdown**:
```tsx
// MessageBubble.tsx
<Streamdown className="prose prose-gray max-w-none">
  {content}  // Should contain ## markers
</Streamdown>
```

**Check normalizeMarkdown**:
- Ensure it's not stripping `##`
- Currently has `normalizeHeadings: true` - should preserve ##

2. ⏳ Test with "Research Stripe"
3. ⏳ Verify planning in thinking indicator only
4. ⏳ Verify all headings render properly
5. ⏳ Check server logs for extraction confirmation
6. ⏳ Monitor for any edge cases
