## Status: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL

Both features are now operational and have passed automated testing.

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Bulk Company Research System

#### Created Files:
- **[app/api/research/bulk/route.ts](app/api/research/bulk/route.ts)** - Job creation endpoint
- **[app/api/research/bulk-runner/route.ts](app/api/research/bulk-runner/route.ts)** - Research processing worker

#### How It Works:

1. **Job Creation** (`POST /api/research/bulk`)
   - Accepts array of company names and research type (quick/deep)
   - Creates `bulk_research_jobs` record
   - Creates individual `bulk_research_tasks` for each company
   - Returns job_id for tracking

2. **Research Processing** (`POST /api/research/bulk-runner`)
   - Takes job_id and optional concurrency parameter
   - Processes pending tasks in parallel batches
   - For each company:
     - Loads user context (ICP, criteria, signal preferences)
     - Calls OpenAI Responses API with web search
     - Saves results to `research_outputs` table
     - Updates task status and job progress
   - Returns summary of processed/succeeded/failed tasks

3. **Progress Tracking** (`GET /api/research/bulk`)
   - Query params: `?job_id=<uuid>` for specific job details
   - No query params: returns recent jobs for user
   - Returns job status, progress, and task details

#### Features:
- ✅ Concurrent processing with configurable batch size
- ✅ Quick mode (400-600 words, 2-3 min per company)
- ✅ Deep mode (comprehensive, 5-10 min per company)
- ✅ Automatic task retry tracking
- ✅ Progress monitoring
- ✅ Error handling with detailed logging

#### Test Results:
```
✅ Created job: 96024ee9-8a51-4e86-9770-512f3600cd0a
✅ Created 3 tasks
✅ Processed 3 companies (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon)
✅ Success rate: 100% (3/3)
✅ Job status: completed
✅ Research outputs saved to database
```

### 2. Background Signal Detection System

#### Created Files:
- **[app/api/signals/detect/route.ts](app/api/signals/detect/route.ts)** - Signal detection worker

#### How It Works:

1. **Signal Detection** (`POST /api/signals/detect`)
   - Parameters:
     - `account_id` (optional): Detect signals for specific account
     - `force` (optional): Force detection even if recently checked
   - Without account_id: processes up to 10 accounts needing refresh
   - For each account:
     - Gets user's signal preferences
     - Calls OpenAI to search for recent business signals
     - Parses JSON response with signal details
     - Saves new signals to `account_signals` table
     - Calculates signal score and priority
     - Updates `tracked_accounts` with latest scores
     - Logs activity to `signal_activity_log`

2. **Activity History** (`GET /api/signals/detect`)
   - Returns recent signal detection activity
   - Shows status, signals detected, and processing details

#### Signal Types Detected:
- Leadership changes
- Funding rounds
- Hiring surges
- Security breaches
- Product launches
- Partnerships
- M&A activity
- Custom user-defined signals

#### Features:
- ✅ Automated signal discovery using OpenAI + web search
- ✅ Respects user signal preferences and lookback periods
- ✅ Intelligent account prioritization (hot/warm/standard)
- ✅ Signal scoring and aggregation
- ✅ Duplicate detection (only new signals saved)
- ✅ Comprehensive activity logging
- ✅ Graceful error handling

#### Test Results:
```
✅ Processed 1 account (DealHub.io)
✅ Signal detection completed successfully
✅ Activity logged to signal_activity_log
✅ Account priority updated correctly
✅ Status: noop (no new signals found - expected for test)
```

3. **tracked_accounts**
   - Accounts being monitored
   - Fields: id, user_id, company_name, monitoring_enabled, signal_score, priority, last_researched_at, etc.

4. **account_signals**
   - Detected signals for accounts
   - Fields: id, account_id, user_id, signal_type, severity, description, signal_date, score, viewed, dismissed, etc.

5. **signal_activity_log**
   - Audit trail of signal detection runs
   - Fields: id, user_id, account_id, signal_type, detector, status, details, detected_signals, created_at

6. **research_outputs**
   - Saved research results
   - Fields: id, user_id, subject, research_type, data, markdown_report, executive_summary, source_task_id, etc.

## API Endpoints

### Bulk Research

#### Create Job
```bash
POST /api/research/bulk
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "companies": ["Boeing", "Lockheed Martin", "Raytheon"],
  "research_type": "quick" | "deep"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "job_id": "uuid",
  "total_count": 3,
  "research_type": "quick"
}
```

#### Process Job
```bash
POST /api/research/bulk-runner
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "job_id": "uuid",
  "concurrency": 3  # optional, default 3
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "job_id": "uuid",
  "processed": 3,
  "succeeded": 3,

## Integration Notes

### Frontend Integration

1. **Bulk Research Dialog** ([src/components/BulkResearchDialog.tsx](src/components/BulkResearchDialog.tsx))
   - Already configured to call `/api/research/bulk` ✅
   - Already kicks off `/api/research/bulk-runner` ✅
   - Ready to use!

2. **CSV Upload Dialog** ([src/components/CSVUploadDialog.tsx](src/components/CSVUploadDialog.tsx))
   - Uploads companies to tracked_accounts
   - Can trigger `/api/signals/detect` after upload
   - Integration point available

3. **Signal Detection**
   - Can be triggered manually via API
   - Should be set up as cron job for automatic scanning
   - Recommended: Run every 24 hours for all accounts

### Recommended Cron Setup

For production, set up cron jobs to run signal detection:

```javascript
// Example cron job (using Vercel Cron or similar)
// Schedule: Every day at 2 AM UTC
export async function POST(req) {
  // Run signal detection for all accounts
  const response = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/signals/detect`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ force: false })
  });

  return Response.json(await response.json());
}
```

## Known Issues & Improvements

### Current Limitations:

1. **OpenAI Response Parsing**
   - Initial implementation had issues extracting text from non-streaming responses
   - ✅ FIXED: Added robust response parsing with multiple fallback paths
   - ✅ Added detailed logging for debugging

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - No built-in rate limiting for OpenAI API calls
   - Recommendation: Add rate limiting for bulk operations
   - Suggested concurrency: 2-3 for deep mode, 3-5 for quick mode

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Tasks currently fail without automatic retry
   - Recommendation: Add retry logic with exponential backoff

### Future Enhancements:

1. **Progress Notifications**
   - Add websocket/polling for real-time progress updates
   - Show progress bar in UI

2. **Signal Alert System**
   - Email/Slack notifications for critical signals
   - Signal digest emails

3. **Bulk Research History**
   - UI component to view past bulk research jobs
   - Download results as CSV/PDF

4. **Advanced Signal Filtering**
   - Allow users to configure custom signal detection rules
   - Machine learning for signal relevance scoring

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"companies": ["Boeing", "Lockheed Martin"], "research_type": "quick"}'

# Get the job_id from response, then:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/research/bulk-runner \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job_id": "YOUR_JOB_ID", "concurrency": 2}'

# 2. Test signal detection
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/signals/detect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"force": true}'
```
