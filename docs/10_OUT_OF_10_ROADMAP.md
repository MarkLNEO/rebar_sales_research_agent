## Remaining Work to Reach 10/10

### ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL PATH (Must-Have for 10/10)

#### Week 1: Implicit Learning Hooks
**Goal**: Automatically learn from user behavior

**Tasks**:
1. **Track Research Depth Choices** (4 hours)
   - Location: `src/pages/ResearchChat.tsx`
   - When: User selects "Deep" or "Quick"
   - Action: `upsertPreferences(userId, [{ key: 'coverage.depth', value: depth, confidence: 0.6, source: 'implicit' }])`

2. **Track Section Engagement** (6 hours)
   - Location: `src/components/MessageBubble.tsx`
   - When: User expands/collapses sections
   - Track: Which sections they engage with most
   - Action: Build `focus.areas` array

3. **Track Follow-Up Patterns** (4 hours)
   - Location: `src/pages/ResearchChat.tsx`
   - When: User asks follow-up questions
   - Detect: Repeated topics (e.g., "tell me about tech stack" 3x)
   - Action: Add to `focus.always_include`

4. **Track Save Behavior** (3 hours)
   - Location: `src/pages/ResearchChat.tsx` (after save)
   - Track: Which research gets saved
   - Learn: Preferred depth, focus areas, output style
   - Action: Increment confidence scores

**Deliverable**: System learns preferences without explicit setup

---

#### Week 2: Adaptive Section Ordering
**Goal**: Dynamic research structure based on learned preferences

**Tasks**:
1. **Build Dynamic Section Generator** (6 hours)
   ```typescript
   function buildAdaptiveSections(prefs: ResolvedPrefs, criteria: CustomCriteria[]): Section[] {
     const sections = [
       { name: 'Executive Summary', priority: 100, required: true }
     ];
     
     // Add high-priority sections based on learned focus
     if (prefs.focus?.areas?.includes('buying_signals')) {
       sections.push({ name: 'Buying Signals', priority: 90, required: true });
     }
     
     if (prefs.focus?.areas?.includes('tech_stack')) {
       sections.push({ name: 'Technology Stack', priority: 85, required: true });
     }
     
     // Add custom criteria (always important)
     if (criteria.length > 0) {
       sections.push({ name: 'Custom Criteria', priority: 80, required: true });
     }
     
     // Lower priority sections (include if relevant)
     sections.push({ name: 'Company Overview', priority: 50, required: false });
     
     return sections.sort((a, b) => b.priority - a.priority);
   }
   ```

2. **Inject into Prompts** (4 hours)
   - Update `buildSystemPrompt()` to use dynamic sections
   - Pass section order to AI
   - AI follows learned structure

3. **Skip Irrelevant Sections** (3 hours)
   - If `prefs.focus.skip_unless_relevant` includes section
   - AI skips unless highly relevant to query
   - Reduces noise, faster responses

**Deliverable**: Research reports adapt to user preferences

---

#### Week 3: Research Memory & Delta Detection
**Goal**: "Here's what's NEW since last time"

**Tasks**:
1. **Create Research History Table** (2 hours)
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE research_history (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     company_name TEXT,
     research_date TIMESTAMP,
     key_findings JSONB,
     signals_detected JSONB,
     icp_score INTEGER,
     summary TEXT
   );
   ```

2. **Store Research Summaries** (4 hours)
   - After each research completion
   - Extract key findings, signals, ICP score
   - Store in `research_history`

3. **Detect Previous Research** (4 hours)
   - Before starting research, check history
   - If found, inject into prompt:
   ```
   Previous research on ${company} (${date}):
   - Key findings: ${findings}
   - Signals: ${signals}
   
   **FOCUS ON CHANGES** since ${date}
   ```

4. **Delta Highlighting** (3 hours)
   - AI highlights what's new/changed
   - "Since last research: New VP hired, funding round closed"
   - Saves user time, increases value

**Deliverable**: No redundant research, always fresh insights

---

### ðŸŽ¯ HIGH IMPACT (Should-Have for 10/10)

#### Week 4: Proactive Suggestions
**Goal**: System suggests next actions

**Tasks**:
1. **Pattern Detection** (6 hours)
   ```typescript
   async function detectPatterns(userId: string) {
     const recent = await getRecentResearch(userId, 10);
     
     // Detect common industry
     const industries = recent.map(r => r.industry);
     const commonIndustry = mostFrequent(industries);
     
     // Detect common criteria
     const criteria = recent.flatMap(r => r.criteria_used);
     const commonCriteria = mostFrequent(criteria);
     
     if (commonIndustry && commonCriteria) {
       return {
         type: 'bulk_research_suggestion',
         message: `You've researched ${recent.length} ${commonIndustry} companies. 
                   Want me to find 20 more matching your criteria?`,
         action: 'start_bulk_research'
       };
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Suggestion UI** (4 hours)
   - Toast notification with suggestion
   - One-click acceptance
   - Dismissible (learn from dismissals)

3. **Account Monitoring** (5 hours)
   - Track accounts automatically
   - Alert on signal changes
   - "Acme Corp just raised Series B (your buying signal)"

**Deliverable**: Proactive intelligence, not reactive

---

#### Week 5: Empty Section Hiding & UI Polish
**Goal**: Clean, noise-free interface

**Tasks**:
1. **Conditional Section Rendering** (3 hours)
   ```tsx
   {keyFindings && keyFindings.length > 0 && (
     <section>
       <h3>Key Findings</h3>
       {keyFindings.map(...)}
     </section>
   )}
   ```

2. **"Saved" Badge** (2 hours)
   - Visual indicator after save
   - Persists until page refresh
   - Clear confirmation

3. **Tooltip Audit** (3 hours)
   - Add tooltips to all action buttons
   - Explain "Refine Focus", "Refresh on this", etc.
   - User education through UI

4. **Setup Flow Audit** (4 hours)
   - Confirm "Skip" removed
   - Simplify wording
   - Test onboarding flow end-to-end

**Deliverable**: Polished, professional UI

---

#### Week 6: Entity Alias Population
**Goal**: "m365" â†’ "Microsoft 365" works

**Tasks**:
1. **Populate Common Aliases** (2 hours)
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO entity_aliases (canonical, aliases, entity_type) VALUES
     ('Microsoft 365', ARRAY['m365', 'office 365', 'o365'], 'product'),
     ('Salesforce', ARRAY['sfdc', 'sales force'], 'product'),
     ('Amazon Web Services', ARRAY['aws'], 'product'),
     ('Google Cloud Platform', ARRAY['gcp'], 'product'),
     ('Kubernetes', ARRAY['k8s'], 'product'),
     -- Add 50+ common aliases
   ```

2. **User-Specific Aliases** (3 hours)
   - Allow users to add custom aliases
   - "We call it 'the platform' internally"
   - Store in `user_entity_aliases`

3. **Alias Learning** (4 hours)
   - Detect when user uses shorthand
   - Suggest alias creation
   - "I noticed you say 'm365'. Should I remember that as Microsoft 365?"

**Deliverable**: Natural language understanding

    const prefs = await getResolvedPreferences(userId);
    const prompt = await buildSystemPrompt(context);
    expect(prompt).toContain('LEARNED USER PREFERENCES');
  });
  
  it('should adapt autonomy based on confidence', () => {
    const highConfidence = { coverage: { depth: 'deep', confidence: 0.9 } };
    const section = buildLearnedPreferencesSection(highConfidence);
    expect(section).toContain('ALWAYS use this depth');
  });
});
```

#### Phase 2: Integration Tests
```typescript
describe('End-to-End Learning', () => {
  it('should learn from research saves', async () => {
    // User does deep research
    await saveResearch(userId, { depth: 'deep' });
    
    // Check preference updated
    const prefs = await getResolvedPreferences(userId);
    expect(prefs.coverage.depth).toBe('deep');
    expect(prefs.coverage.confidence).toBeGreaterThan(0.5);
  });
});
```

#### Phase 3: User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] 10 users test for 1 week
- [ ] Track: preference formation, satisfaction, friction points
- [ ] Iterate based on feedback

### ðŸŽ¯ DEFINITION OF 10/10

A platform is 10/10 when:

1. **âœ… It learns** - Preferences automatically captured and used
2. **âœ… It adapts** - Behavior changes based on confidence
3. **âœ… It anticipates** - Suggests next actions proactively
4. **âœ… It remembers** - No redundant research, delta detection
5. **âœ… It's transparent** - Users see what's been learned
6. **âœ… It's fast** - <30 sec to actionable insight
7. **âœ… It's personalized** - Every user gets unique experience
8. **âœ… It's reliable** - Graceful degradation, no breaking changes
9. **âœ… It's extensible** - Easy to add new learning dimensions
10. **âœ… It's delightful** - Users say "wow, it just gets me"
