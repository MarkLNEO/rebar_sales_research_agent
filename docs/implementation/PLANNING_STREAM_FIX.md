# 🔧 Planning Checklist Streaming Fix

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Issue**: Planning checklists not appearing as separate thinking indicators  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Build**: ✅ Passing

## 🐛 Problem

After implementing Phase 2 optimizations, planning checklists were appearing in the final response text instead of streaming as separate thinking/planning indicators like the design intended.

### **What Users Saw** (Before Fix):

```
[No thinking indicator]

Response text:
🎯 Research Plan:
- Assess ICP fit based on industry
- Search for recent buying signals
- Identify decision makers
...

[Rest of research appears below]
```

### **What Was Expected**:

```
[Blue ThinkingIndicator box shows:]
🎯 Research Plan:
- Assess ICP fit based on industry  
- Search for recent buying signals
- Identify decision makers
...

[Then research content streams below]
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**The Problem**:
1. Phase 2 added `<planning>` section to prompt
2. Model outputs planning as regular text content
3. Backend streams it as `type: 'content'` events
4. Frontend displays it as part of the message, not as thinking indicator

**Why It Happened**:
- Planning checklist is prompt-driven output, not a native OpenAI event
- OpenAI Responses API has `response.reasoning.delta` for internal reasoning
- But our planning checklist is explicit user-facing output
- Need custom parsing to extract it as a separate event

---

## ✅ Solution

### **Two-Part Fix**:

#### **1. Backend Parsing** (`route.ts`)

Added content buffering and pattern detection:

```typescript
let contentBuffer = ''; // Buffer to detect planning checklist
let planningExtracted = false;

// Buffer incoming text
if (event.type === 'response.output_text.delta' && event.delta) {
  contentBuffer += event.delta;
  
  // Try to extract planning from beginning of response
  if (!planningExtracted && contentBuffer.length > 50) {
    const planMatch = contentBuffer.match(/🎯\s*(?:Research\s+)?Plan:?\s*\n([\s\S]{20,500}?)\n\n/);
    
    if (planMatch) {
      planningExtracted = true;
      
      // Send planning as reasoning_progress event
      controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`data: ${JSON.stringify({
        type: 'reasoning_progress',
        content: planMatch[0].trim()
      })}\n\n`));
      
      // Continue with content after the plan
      const afterPlan = contentBuffer.substring(planMatch.index! + planMatch[0].length);
      if (afterPlan) {
        controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`data: ${JSON.stringify({
          type: 'content',
          content: afterPlan
        })}\n\n`));
      }
      contentBuffer = '';
    }
  }
  
  // Fallback: if buffer > 800 chars and no plan, stream as-is
  if (!planningExtracted && contentBuffer.length > 800) {
    planningExtracted = true;
    controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`data: ${JSON.stringify({
      type: 'content',
      content: contentBuffer
    })}\n\n`));
    contentBuffer = '';
  }
}
```

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Start buffering at 50 chars**: Enough to detect emoji + header
- **Stop buffering at 800 chars**: Prevents delay if no plan present
- **Regex pattern**: Matches `🎯 Research Plan:` + bullets + blank line
- **Flexible**: Also matches `🎯 Plan:` without "Research"

---

#### **2. Prompt Update** (`context.ts`)

Made format explicit and detectable:

```xml
<planning>
Before starting research, output a brief conceptual checklist (3-7 bullets) of your planned approach.

IMPORTANT: Format it EXACTLY like this (with the target emoji and label):

🎯 Research Plan:
- [First investigation step]
- [Second investigation step]
- [Third investigation step]
- [etc...]

Example:
🎯 Research Plan:
- Assess ICP fit based on industry and company size
- Search for recent buying signals (funding, hiring, tech changes)
- Identify key decision makers and personalization angles
- Analyze timing and urgency factors
- Synthesize into actionable recommendations

Keep items conceptual (what you'll investigate), not technical (how you'll do it).
After the plan, add a blank line, then begin your research with progress updates.
</planning>
```

**Why This Works**:
- **Explicit format**: Model knows exact structure to output
- **Emoji marker**: Easy to detect with regex
- **Blank line**: Clear boundary between plan and research
- **Example included**: Model sees expected format

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Flow Diagram**:

```
1. User: "Research Stripe"
   ↓
2. Model generates response:
   "🎯 Research Plan:
    - Assess ICP fit...
    - Search for signals...
    
    [Progress update text...]"
   ↓
3. Backend buffers first ~100 chars
   ↓
4. Regex matches planning pattern
   ↓
5. Extract plan, send as reasoning_progress event
   → Frontend shows in blue ThinkingIndicator
   ↓
6. Send remaining content as regular content events
   → Frontend streams in message bubble
```

---

## 📊 Technical Details

### **Regex Pattern**:
```javascript
/🎯\s*(?:Research\s+)?Plan:?\s*\n([\s\S]{20,500}?)\n\n/
```

**Breakdown**:
- `🎯` - Target emoji (required)
- `\s*` - Optional whitespace
- `(?:Research\s+)?` - Optional "Research " word
- `Plan:?` - "Plan" with optional colon
- `\s*\n` - Whitespace then newline
- `([\s\S]{20,500}?)` - Capture 20-500 chars (bullets)
- `\n\n` - Double newline (plan ends)

**Why 20-500 chars?**:
- Min 20: At least one bullet with text
- Max 500: 3-7 bullets with reasonable text
- Prevents matching too much content

---

### **Fallback Behavior**:

```typescript
// If no planning detected yet and buffer is large, start sending content
if (!planningExtracted && contentBuffer.length > 800) {
  planningExtracted = true; // Stop looking
  controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`data: ${JSON.stringify({
    type: 'content',
    content: contentBuffer
  })}\n\n`));
  contentBuffer = '';
}
```

**Why 800 chars?**:
- Planning should appear in first ~200 chars
- 800 chars is ~4x buffer for safety
- Prevents content delay if model doesn't follow format
- Ensures graceful degradation

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior After Fix

### **Normal Research Flow**:

**1. User enters**: `"Research Stripe"`

**2. Frontend shows** (immediately):
```
[Blue ThinkingIndicator box]
🎯 Research Plan:
- Assess ICP fit for enterprise fintech
- Search for recent funding/product launches
- Identify security decision makers
- Analyze timing and urgency
- Synthesize recommendations
```

**3. Then research streams** (below indicator):
```
Progress update — starting research: 🔍 Checking validation,
acquisitions, product/news signals...

[Research results appear]
```

---

### **Edge Cases Handled**:

**Case 1: Model doesn't output planning**
- Buffer hits 800 chars
- All content streams as regular text
- No ThinkingIndicator
- User sees normal research output

**Case 2: Model uses different format**
- Regex doesn't match
- Content streams as regular text
- Graceful degradation

**Case 3: Very short plan**
- Regex min 20 chars prevents false positives
- Short but valid plans still extracted

**Case 4: Very long plan**
- Regex max 500 chars prevents over-matching
- Long plans truncated at blank line

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### **Unit Test Scenarios**:

- [ ] **Perfect format**: `🎯 Research Plan:\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n\nContent`
  - ✅ Should extract plan
  - ✅ Should send as reasoning_progress
  - ✅ Should stream remaining content

- [ ] **No plan**: Regular text with no emoji/pattern
  - ✅ Should buffer up to 800 chars
  - ✅ Should stream all as content
  - ✅ No reasoning_progress event

- [ ] **Plan with "Research"**: `🎯 Research Plan:`
  - ✅ Should match and extract

- [ ] **Plan without "Research"**: `🎯 Plan:`
  - ✅ Should match and extract

- [ ] **Plan with colon**: `🎯 Research Plan:`
  - ✅ Should match

- [ ] **Plan without colon**: `🎯 Research Plan`
  - ✅ Should match

### **Integration Test** (Use Testing Rubric):

**Test 1: Standard Research** from `TESTING_RUBRIC_PHASE_1_2.md`

**Steps**:
1. Open app in browser
2. Start new chat
3. Enter: `"Research Stripe"`
4. Observe output

**Expected**:
- ✅ Blue ThinkingIndicator appears with planning checklist
- ✅ Planning uses 🎯 emoji and format
- ✅ Contains 3-7 relevant bullets
- ✅ Research content streams below (not including plan)
- ✅ No duplicate plan text in main message

**Score**:
- **10/10**: Planning appears perfectly in indicator
- **7/10**: Planning appears but formatting issues
- **4/10**: Planning in wrong place or duplicated
- **0/10**: No planning visible or not working

---

## 📈 Impact

### **Before Fix**:
- ❌ Planning appears in message text
- ❌ Less visibility into approach
- ❌ Clutters main output
- ❌ Phase 2 intent not achieved

### **After Fix**:
- ✅ Planning appears in separate indicator
- ✅ Clear visibility into agent's strategy
- ✅ Clean main output (no plan duplication)
- ✅ Phase 2 intent fully realized
- ✅ Better UX - see plan before research
