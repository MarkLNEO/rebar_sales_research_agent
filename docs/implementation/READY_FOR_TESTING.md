## 🧪 Phase 3: Production Testing Instructions

### **How to Test**

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Run Test Scenarios** (see below)

---

## 📋 Test Scenarios

### **Test 1: Quick Brief** ⏱️ (Should be fast)

**Input**: 
```
Quick brief on Stripe
```

**What to Watch For**:
- ✅ **Progress indicators**: Look for "🔍 Researching Stripe..." in UI
- ✅ **Console logs**: Check for `[chat] Using reasoning effort: low`
- ✅ **Speed**: Response in < 30 seconds
- ✅ **Output quality**: Concise, focused insights
- ✅ **No banned phrases**: No "PREFERENCE CHECK-OUT" or formal language
- ✅ **Natural follow-ups**: "Ready to draft..." style suggestions

**Where to Look**:
- **UI**: Thinking panel should show progress messages
- **Console**: Browser dev tools → Console tab
- **Network**: Check `/api/ai/chat` response stream

---

### **Test 2: Deep Research** 🔬 (Should be thorough)

**Input**:
```
Deep research on Salesforce for enterprise sales
```

**What to Watch For**:
- ✅ **Progress indicators**: Multiple status updates throughout
- ✅ **Console logs**: Check for `[chat] Using reasoning effort: medium`
- ✅ **Output quality**: 5-7 key findings, ICP scoring, detailed analysis
- ✅ **Tool preambles**: Should see friendly progress messages
- ✅ **No contradictions**: Shouldn't ask clarifying questions
- ✅ **Autonomous completion**: Finishes without asking "should I continue?"

---

### **Test 3: Follow-Up Question** 🔄 (Should be fast)

**Turn 1**:
```
Research Stripe
```

**Turn 2** (after first completes):
```
What about their recent acquisitions?
```

**What to Watch For**:
- ✅ **Console logs**: Second turn should use `reasoning effort: low`
- ✅ **Speed**: Follow-up faster than initial research
- ✅ **Context awareness**: Doesn't re-introduce Stripe, builds on previous
- ✅ **No re-research**: Uses previous context efficiently

---

### **Test 4: UI Progress Indicators** 🎨

**What to Verify**:
- ✅ **Thinking panel visible**: Should open during research
- ✅ **Progress messages appear**: "🔍 Researching...", "Analyzing...", "✅ Complete"
- ✅ **Clear when done**: Status messages disappear when content starts
- ✅ **No JSON visible**: Status messages formatted cleanly, not raw JSON

---

## 🔍 Console Verification

**Open browser console** (Chrome: F12 → Console tab)

**Look for these logs**:

```
[chat] Starting stream for user: xxx chatId: xxx agentType: xxx
[chat] Using reasoning effort: low (or medium)
[chat] Calling OpenAI Responses API...
```

**Reasoning Effort Logic**:
- `agentType === 'quick'` → `low`
- `message.length < 50` → `low` (follow-ups)
- Otherwise → `medium` (default)

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Phase 3 passes if**:

1. ✅ **Progress indicators visible** - User sees what's happening
2. ✅ **Reasoning effort logged** - Console shows dynamic effort
3. ✅ **Quick tasks are faster** - < 30s for quick briefs
4. ✅ **No "PREFERENCE CHECK-OUT"** - Natural language only
5. ✅ **Tool preambles show** - Friendly progress messages
6. ✅ **No contradictions** - Doesn't ask then research anyway
7. ✅ **Build stable** - No errors in console
8. ✅ **Output quality maintained** - Still insightful and actionable

---

## 🚨 Red Flags (Roll Back If...)

- ❌ Response quality degrades
- ❌ More errors than before
- ❌ Progress indicators don't show
- ❌ Reasoning effort always `medium` (not dynamic)
- ❌ Users complain about verbosity
- ❌ Cost increases significantly

---

## 📊 What Changed vs Before

### **User Experience**
**Before**:
- Silent processing → sudden response
- No idea what's happening
- Same speed for everything

**After**:
- "🔍 Researching..." → "Analyzing..." → "✅ Complete"
- Clear progress throughout
- Quick tasks faster, deep tasks thorough

### **System Behavior**
**Before**:
- Contradictory instructions caused confusion
- "Be concise but complete" → inconsistent
- "PREFERENCE CHECK-OUT" → robotic language
- Fixed reasoning effort → inefficient

**After**:
- Clear instruction hierarchy (Priority 1-4)
- No contradictions → predictable behavior
- Natural follow-up language → friendly
- Dynamic reasoning → efficient

### **Technical**
**Before**:
```typescript
reasoning: { effort: 'medium' } // Always medium
```

**After**:
```typescript
reasoning: { 
  effort: getReasoningEffort(agentType, message) // Dynamic!
}
verbosity: 'medium' // Can override in prompt
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Metrics

### **Performance**
- **Quick brief**: 15-30s (was 60-90s)
- **Deep research**: 90-120s (unchanged, but better quality)
- **Follow-ups**: 10-20s (was 60s)

### **Quality**
- **Consistency**: Higher (no contradictions)
- **Completeness**: Better (persistence instructions)
- **Insights**: More specific (quality threshold in prompt)

### **Cost**
- **Quick tasks**: 30-40% less tokens (low reasoning)
- **Deep tasks**: Similar tokens (still medium)
- **Overall**: 15-25% savings

---

## 🛠️ Debugging Tips

### **If progress indicators don't show**:
1. Check `ResearchChat.tsx` - is `ThinkingEvent` type including 'status'?
2. Check `ThinkingIndicator.tsx` - is status case handled?
3. Check console for SSE messages

### **If reasoning effort not dynamic**:
1. Check console logs: `[chat] Using reasoning effort: xxx`
2. Verify `getReasoningEffort()` function in `route.ts`
3. Check request body has correct `agentType`

### **If contradictions persist**:
1. Re-run verification: `node test-prompt-generation.js`
2. Check `context.ts` for banned phrases
3. Verify prompt generation in console
