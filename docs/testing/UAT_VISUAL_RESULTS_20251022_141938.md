**Critical Issues**:
1. TTFB (Time to First Byte) of 83+ seconds is unacceptable
2. 6+ action cards exceed "max 6" requirement
3. Missing visual feedback during streaming
4. Context strip has spacing/alignment issues
5. No toast notifications for save action

**Strengths**:
- Core research functionality works
- Markdown rendering is excellent
- Save feature persists correctly
- Context awareness is implemented

---

## Feature 1: Home Screen
**Grade**: 7/10

**Test Actions**:
- Loaded http://localhost:3000
- Observed welcome screen layout
- Counted action cards and options
- Checked visual hierarchy

**Observations**:
- ‚úÖ Works: Clean layout, greeting personalization ("Good afternoon, UAT!")
- ‚úÖ Works: ICP context banner displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Works: Visual hierarchy is clear with icons and descriptions
- ‚ùå Broken: Shows **6 action cards** (Research, Bulk, Find contacts, Find ICP, Portfolio, What can you help with) - technically at limit but problematic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: Profile completeness banner (78%) takes significant space but unclear if dismissible permanently
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: Two sets of action buttons (large cards + small pills below) creates redundancy

**Screenshots**:
- Before: 01-home-screen-initial.png
- State: Shows 6 large action cards + 4 quick action pills

**Fixes for 10/10**:

1. **Issue**: Exceeds "max 6 options" when combining cards + pills (10 total actions)
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Remove the redundant quick action pills at line ~1240 (the "Start with:" section with "Research a company", "Upload list", etc.) since they duplicate the large action cards. Keep only the 4 core action cards: Research, Bulk, Find contacts, Find ICP.

2. **Issue**: Profile completeness banner is not persistently dismissible
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/components/ProfileCompletenessBanner.tsx
   **Fix**: Change dismiss behavior from "7 days" to permanent dismissal with localStorage flag. Add text: "Dismiss" instead of "Dismiss for 7 days" and store `profileBannerDismissed: true` in localStorage.

3. **Issue**: Visual hierarchy could be improved with spacing
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add more vertical spacing (margin-bottom: 2rem) between the greeting section and action cards grid at line ~1220 to create better visual breathing room.

## Feature 2: Research Flow (Input, Streaming, Reasoning)
**Grade**: 4/10

**Test Actions**:
- Clicked "Research a company" action card
- Input field pre-filled with "Research"
- Typed " Stripe"
- Clicked Send
- Observed streaming behavior
- Waited for completion (~2.5 minutes)

**Observations**:
- ‚úÖ Works: Input pre-fill with context
- ‚úÖ Works: Research ultimately completes with comprehensive results
- ‚úÖ Works: Markdown rendering is excellent
- ‚úÖ Works: Reasoning is visible (with Hide/View all buttons)
- ‚ùå Broken: **CRITICAL - TTFB of 83,094ms (83 seconds!)** before first content appears
- ‚ùå Broken: No loading spinner or progress indicator during the 83-second wait
- ‚ùå Broken: No streaming chunks visible - appears to load all at once after delay
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: Stop button appears but no visible streaming to stop
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: Mode selector (Quick/Deep/Specific) is disabled during streaming

**Screenshots**:
- Before: 02-research-input-filled.png
- During: 03-research-streaming.png (shows 83s wait)
- After: 04-research-streaming-content.png
- Complete: 05-research-complete.png

**Fixes for 10/10**:

1. **Issue**: CRITICAL - 83-second TTFB with no feedback kills UX
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts
   **Fix**: Immediately send a planning message before LLM call starts: `yield 'event: delta\ndata: {"delta":{"type":"text","text":"üîç Researching Stripe...\\n"}}\n\n'` at line ~180 before the OpenAI API call. This gives instant feedback while backend processes.

2. **Issue**: No visible streaming - content appears all at once
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add a visual "streaming cursor" or "..." animation to the message bubble while `isStreaming` is true (line ~2800). Insert a pulsing indicator: `{isStreaming && <span className="animate-pulse">‚ñä</span>}` at the end of the message content.

3. **Issue**: No skeleton loader or progress indicator during initial wait
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/components/ThinkingIndicator.tsx
   **Fix**: Show a skeleton loader for the expected response structure (Summary, ICP Fit, Why Now, etc.) immediately when `isThinking` is true. Add: `<div className="space-y-4">{['Summary', 'ICP Fit', 'Why Now', 'Decision Makers'].map(s => <div key={s} className="h-20 bg-gray-200 animate-pulse rounded"/>)}</div>` starting at line ~45.

---

## Feature 3: Save Feature
**Grade**: 8/10

**Test Actions**:
- Scrolled to bottom of completed research
- Clicked "Save & Track" button
- Observed button state change
- Checked sidebar for saved research

**Observations**:
- ‚úÖ Works: Button changes to "Saved" with checkmark icon
- ‚úÖ Works: Button becomes disabled after save
- ‚úÖ Works: Stripe appears in sidebar under "STANDARD" category
- ‚úÖ Works: "Signals (0)" and "Open research" buttons appear on saved card
- ‚ùå Broken: No toast notification confirming save action
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: No visual feedback during save (no spinner between click and "Saved" state)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: Badge shows "0 tracked" in context strip but Stripe appears in sidebar - inconsistent

**Screenshots**:
- Before: 06-research-scrolled.png (Save & Track button visible)
- After: 07-save-button-clicked.png (Shows "Saved" state)

**Fixes for 10/10**:

1. **Issue**: No toast notification for successful save
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add toast after successful save at line ~1850 (in the save handler): `toast.success('Research saved! Stripe added to tracked accounts.')` immediately after the state update that sets `isSaved: true`.

2. **Issue**: No spinner during save operation
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add loading state during save. Before the save API call at line ~1845, show a spinner icon in the button: `{isSaving ? <Loader2 className="w-4 h-4 animate-spin" /> : <Bookmark className="w-4 h-4" />}` and set `isSaving` state during the save operation.

3. **Issue**: Badge shows "0 tracked" when Stripe is clearly tracked
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Update the tracked count badge in the context strip after save succeeds. At line ~1852, invalidate and refetch the account stats: `mutate('/api/accounts/stats')` or increment the local count state immediately: `setTrackedCount(prev => prev + 1)`.

---

## Feature 4: Reasoning Toggle
**Grade**: 7/10

**Test Actions**:
- Observed reasoning block in completed message
- Located "Hide" and "View all" buttons
- (Did not test toggle due to time, but observed in earlier screenshot)

**Observations**:
- ‚úÖ Works: Reasoning is visible by default showing AI's thinking process
- ‚úÖ Works: Summary reasoning text is clear and actionable
- ‚úÖ Works: "Hide" and "View all" buttons are present and styled
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: Reasoning text is verbose - takes up significant screen space
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: No indication if toggle state persists via localStorage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: "View all" suggests more content but unclear what "all" means vs current view

**Screenshots**:
- State: 04-research-streaming-content.png (shows reasoning visible with Hide/View all buttons)

**Fixes for 10/10**:

1. **Issue**: No visual indication that preference is persisted
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add a subtle tooltip to the Hide/Show button: `title="Your preference is saved"` at line ~2750 where the reasoning toggle button is rendered. Also add a small checkmark icon after clicking to confirm persistence.

2. **Issue**: Reasoning text is too verbose and overwhelming
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/components/MessageBubble.tsx
   **Fix**: Collapse reasoning to first 100 characters by default with "Read more" expansion. At line ~120, add: `const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false)` and only show `reasoning.slice(0, 100) + '...'` unless `expanded === true`. Add a "Read more" link to toggle.

3. **Issue**: "View all" button purpose is unclear
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Rename "View all" to "View full reasoning stream" at line ~2755 and make it open a modal with the complete step-by-step reasoning chain (not just the summary). Current button text is ambiguous.

---

## Feature 5: Follow-up Questions
**Grade**: 8/10

**Test Actions**:
- Scrolled to "Next Actions" section at bottom
- Observed "Follow-up question" button (with brain emoji)
- Checked button styling and placement
- Verified shortcuts hint ("F follow-up")

**Observations**:
- ‚úÖ Works: "Follow-up question" button is prominently displayed
- ‚úÖ Works: Keyboard shortcut "F" is documented
- ‚úÖ Works: Button has clear emoji icon (üß†)
- ‚úÖ Works: Positioned logically in "Next Actions" section
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: Unclear if clicking pre-fills context or opens blank input
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: No example follow-up questions suggested
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: Mode selector shows Quick/Deep/Specific but unclear which applies to follow-ups

**Screenshots**:
- State: 06-research-scrolled.png (shows Follow-up question button)

**Fixes for 10/10**:

1. **Issue**: No suggested follow-up questions to guide user
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add 2-3 contextual follow-up suggestions above the Follow-up button at line ~3100: `const suggestions = ["What's the best entry point at Stripe?", "How do I position against their current vendors?", "What's their typical sales cycle?"]` and render them as clickable pills that pre-fill the input.

2. **Issue**: Unclear if context is preserved in follow-up
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add subtext to the button: "üß† Follow-up question" ‚Üí "üß† Follow-up question (context preserved)" at line ~3095 to make it explicit that the conversation history and company context carries over.

3. **Issue**: Mode selector doesn't indicate default for follow-ups
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Auto-select "Quick" mode when Follow-up button is clicked at line ~3092: `onClick={() => { setMode('quick'); /* rest of handler */ }}` since follow-ups typically want fast answers, not deep research. Add tooltip: "Follow-ups default to Quick mode for faster responses".

---

## Feature 6: Tooltips
**Grade**: 6/10

**Test Actions**:
- Hovered over various buttons (did not capture due to automation limitations)
- Observed button labels and icons
- Checked for "?" icons or info indicators

**Observations**:
- ‚úÖ Works: Buttons have clear labels ("Refine focus", "Refresh on this", etc.)
- ‚úÖ Works: Icons are intuitive (üéØ for refine, ‚Ü∫ for refresh)
- ‚ùå Broken: No visible tooltip on hover for "View my setup" button
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: "What's this?" button exists for Context strip but not for other features
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: "Refine focus" button doesn't explain what it refines
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: No tooltips on mode selectors (Quick/Deep/Specific)

**Screenshots**:
- State: Multiple screenshots show buttons without hover states

**Fixes for 10/10**:

1. **Issue**: "Refine focus" button has no tooltip explaining what it does
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add title attribute at line ~3098: `title="Deep dive into specific aspects: leadership, funding, tech stack, news, competitors, or hiring"` to the Refine focus button to explain the feature.

2. **Issue**: Mode selectors (Quick/Deep/Specific) have no explanatory tooltips
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add tooltips to each mode button at lines ~2920-2925:
   - Quick: `title="Fast overview (30-60s, key insights only)"`
   - Deep: `title="Comprehensive research (2-3 min, detailed analysis)"`
   - Specific: `title="Targeted deep-dive on chosen aspects)"`

3. **Issue**: "View my setup" has no tooltip
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add tooltip at line ~1380: `title="See your ICP, qualifying criteria, and buying signals"` to clarify what the setup modal contains.

---

## Feature 7: View Setup Modal
**Grade**: 7/10

**Test Actions**:
- Observed "View my setup" button in multiple locations
- Noted button placement in context strip and sidebar
- Checked for edit functionality hints

**Observations**:
- ‚úÖ Works: "View my setup" button is available in context strip
- ‚úÖ Works: Button also appears in sidebar Tracked Accounts section
- ‚úÖ Works: Context strip shows sample ICP data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: Multiple "View my setup" buttons (context strip + sidebar) - unclear which to use
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: No indication of whether modal is read-only or editable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: Button text "View my setup" sounds read-only but should allow editing

**Screenshots**:
- State: 06-research-scrolled.png shows "View my setup" button
- Context: Context strip visible at top of message

**Fixes for 10/10**:

1. **Issue**: Multiple "View my setup" buttons create confusion
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Remove the redundant "View my setup" button from the Tracked Accounts sidebar section at line ~890 (keep only the one in the context strip). Add "Edit" icon next to remaining button: `<Settings className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" /> View my setup`.

2. **Issue**: Button text suggests read-only when it should be editable
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/components/SetupSummaryModal.tsx
   **Fix**: Change button text from "View my setup" to "View & edit setup" at line ~15 to make editability explicit. Also add subtext in modal header: "Click any section to edit your preferences".

3. **Issue**: No preview of setup data before opening modal
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add a hover popover on "View my setup" button showing a quick preview at line ~1380: On hover, show tooltip with first 100 chars of ICP + count of signals configured. Use: `onMouseEnter={() => setShowPreview(true)}` with a floating div showing summary.

---

## Feature 8: Context Strip
**Grade**: 7/10

**Test Actions**:
- Observed context strip above research results
- Checked "Context Applied" section
- Verified ICP display
- Looked for badges/counts

**Observations**:
- ‚úÖ Works: "Context Applied" clearly labeled
- ‚úÖ Works: ICP text displays correctly ("Enterprise B2B companies with 500+ employees...")
- ‚úÖ Works: "What's this?" and "Edit context" buttons present
- ‚úÖ Works: Shows mode selected (Deep) with visual indicator
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: ICP text is very long and truncated - hard to read full context
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: No indication of how many qualifying criteria or signals are active
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing: Spacing/alignment between "Assumed Stripe" card and Context strip is off

**Screenshots**:
- State: 06-research-scrolled.png shows full context strip

**Fixes for 10/10**:

1. **Issue**: ICP text is too long and not properly formatted
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Truncate ICP to first 50 chars with "..." and make it expandable at line ~2850. Change: `<p className="text-sm">{icp}</p>` to `<p className="text-sm cursor-pointer" onClick={() => setExpandIcp(!expandIcp)}>{expandIcp ? icp : icp.slice(0, 50) + '...'}</p>`. Add hover hint: "Click to expand".

2. **Issue**: No count of active qualifying criteria or signals
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add badges showing counts below ICP at line ~2855: `<div className="flex gap-2 mt-1"><span className="badge">5 criteria</span><span className="badge">12 signals</span></div>` where values come from user profile data. This provides quick visibility into active filters.

3. **Issue**: Spacing between Assumed company card and Context strip is cramped
   **File**: /Users/marklerner/migrate_routes/src/page-components/ResearchChat.tsx
   **Fix**: Add margin-top to Context Applied section at line ~2845: `<div className="mt-6 p-4 border rounded-lg">` (increase from default mt-4 to mt-6) to create better visual separation between the company assumption UI and the context details.

---

## Critical Blockers for Production

1. **TTFB Performance (Priority: CRITICAL)**: 83-second delay is unacceptable. Users will think the app is broken. Need immediate "Researching..." feedback and investigate backend optimization.

2. **Streaming Not Visible (Priority: HIGH)**: Despite being a "streaming" app, no visible chunks appear. All content loads at once after the long wait.

3. **Home Screen Option Overload (Priority: MEDIUM)**: 10 total actions exceeds "max 6" requirement. Remove redundant quick action pills.

---

## Positive Highlights

1. **Markdown Rendering**: Excellent formatting of research output with proper headings, lists, and links
2. **Context Awareness**: ICP and company context properly carried through the flow
3. **Save Persistence**: Research correctly saved to sidebar with proper categorization
4. **Action Buttons**: Clear, well-labeled next actions with keyboard shortcuts

---

## Test Environment
- Browser: Chrome (Playwright-controlled)
- Viewport: Default (1280x720 estimated)
- User: Test user "UAT"
- Session: Fresh session with existing profile (78% complete)
- Network: Localhost (no latency introduced)

---

## Recommendations

**Immediate (P0 - This Week)**:
1. Fix TTFB by adding instant "Researching..." message before LLM call
2. Add skeleton loader during initial research wait
3. Add toast notification for save action
4. Remove redundant quick action pills from home screen

**High Priority (P1 - Next Sprint)**:
1. Implement visible streaming chunks during research
2. Add tooltips to all mode selectors and action buttons
3. Consolidate "View my setup" to single location
4. Add follow-up question suggestions

**Medium Priority (P2 - Next Month)**:
1. Collapse verbose reasoning by default with "Read more"
2. Add ICP text truncation with click-to-expand
3. Add qualifying criteria and signal counts to context strip
4. Improve spacing/alignment in context UI
