## 📝 All Changes at a Glance

### **Phase 1: Reliability & Structure** ✅

**1. Numbered Instruction Hierarchy**
```
1. User's explicit request takes absolute priority
2. Complete research autonomously before deferring to user
3. Balance speed and depth according to task complexity
4. Apply output formatting and style preferences
```
→ Clearer priority resolution in conflicts

**2. Enhanced Deduplication**
```
2. Review results and deduplicate findings:
   - Read top 2-3 results per search
   - Consolidate duplicate information across sources
   - Resolve contradictions (prioritize recent, credible)
   - Flag unverifiable claims for follow-up or omission
```
→ Fewer contradictions, cleaner outputs

**3. Validation Loop**
```xml
<validation>
After each tool call or significant operation:
1. Validate the result in 1-2 lines
2. Self-correct if validation fails
3. Proceed only with verified information

Examples:
✅ "Found 3 recent funding events from credible sources"
❌ "No leadership data" → Self-correct: "Searching LinkedIn"
</validation>
```
→ Self-correction mechanism, reduced errors

**4. Parallel Query Optimization**
```
Run independent read-only queries in parallel, then deduplicate 
and resolve conflicts before proceeding with synthesis.
```
→ Explicit workflow, better for GPT-5

---

### **Phase 2: Planning & Transparency** ✅

**1. Conceptual Planning Checklist**
```xml
<planning>
Before starting research, output a brief conceptual checklist (3-7 bullets):

Example:
- Assess ICP fit based on industry and company size
- Search for recent buying signals (funding, hiring, tech)
- Identify key decision makers and personalization angles
- Analyze timing and urgency factors
- Synthesize into actionable recommendations

Keep items conceptual (what), not technical (how).
</planning>
```
→ Explicit planning phase, better multi-step reasoning

**2. Enhanced Tool Preambles**
```
Before each significant tool call, state in one line:
- **Purpose**: Why this action matters
- **Inputs**: What you're looking for

Example: "🔍 Purpose: Find recent buying signals. Inputs: Funding, hiring, tech (90 days)"
```
→ Transparent reasoning, easier to follow

**3. Better Query Examples**
```
- Specific queries: Use "[Company] Series B funding 2024" not "[Company] funding"
- Recent time bounds: Add "[Company] hiring 2024" or "[Company] news last 90 days"
```
→ Clearer guidance, better search quality

---

## 🔄 User Experience Transformation

### **Baseline Experience**:
```
User: "Research Stripe"

[Silent processing...]
"Checking recent funding..."
[Results appear]

Issues:
- No visibility into plan
- Silent tool usage
- No self-correction
- Potential contradictions
```

### **After Phase 1 + 2**:
```
User: "Research Stripe"

🎯 Research Plan:
- Assess ICP fit: Fortune 500, payment infrastructure
- Search signals: funding, hiring, product launches
- Identify decision makers: CFO, CTO, payment leadership
- Analyze timing: recent funding, team expansion
- Synthesize: actionable recommendations

🔍 Purpose: Find recent buying signals. Inputs: Funding events, executive hires, product launches (90 days)

[Parallel web searches...]

✅ Validated: Found 3 funding events from credible sources (TechCrunch, company PR)

"Analyzing findings and consolidating..."

[Clean, deduplicated results with citations]

Benefits:
✅ Visible upfront plan
✅ Clear purpose for each action
✅ Self-corrects errors
✅ No contradictions
✅ Credible sources
```
