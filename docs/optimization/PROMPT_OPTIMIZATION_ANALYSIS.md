## üîç Key Insights from Optimization

### **1. Conceptual Checklist at Start** ‚≠ê
**Insight**: "For GPT-5, checklists at the outset enhance multi-step reasoning and planning"

**What Changed**:
```
Begin with a concise checklist (3‚Äì7 bullets) of your planned sub-tasks 
before starting the research process; keep checklist items conceptual, 
not implementation-level.
```

**Why It Matters**:
- GPT-5 benefits from explicit planning phase
- Conceptual (not technical) checklists improve reasoning
- Forces model to think before acting

**Current State**: ‚ùå Not implemented
**Recommendation**: Add to beginning of research flow

---

### **2. Numbered Instruction Hierarchy** ‚≠ê
**Insight**: "Clarified and standardized the instruction hierarchy into a numbered list"

**What Changed**:
```markdown
<instruction_hierarchy>
1. User's explicit request takes absolute priority.
2. Complete research autonomously before deferring to the user.
3. Balance speed and depth according to task complexity and learned preferences.
4. Apply output formatting and style preferences as appropriate.
</instruction_hierarchy>
```

**Why It Matters**:
- Numbers > descriptive labels for priority clarity
- Easier to reference in conflict resolution
- Better for model's internal reasoning

**Current State**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially implemented (has priorities but not numbered)
**Recommendation**: Convert to numbered list (1-4)

---

### **3. Tool Preambles with Purpose/Inputs** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Insight**: "Before any significant tool call, state in one line: the purpose of the call and the minimal necessary inputs"

**What Added**:
```
Before any significant tool call, state in one line: 
the purpose of the call and the minimal necessary inputs.
```

**Why It Matters**:
- GPT-5 best practice for transparency
- Helps users follow chain of reasoning
- Aids in debugging and validation
- Improves self-correction

**Current State**: ‚úÖ Has preambles, ‚ùå missing "purpose + inputs" requirement
**Recommendation**: Add explicit requirement to state purpose/inputs before tool use

---

### **4. Condensed & Grouped Logic** ‚≠ê
**Insight**: "Condensed instructions and merged overlapping constraints, ensuring autonomy, minimum actionable findings, and no clarifying question templates"

**Why It Matters**:
- Reduces redundancy
- Groups related concepts
- Improves maintainability
- Clearer mental model

**Current State**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Some redundancy exists
**Recommendation**: Audit and consolidate overlapping sections

---

### **5. Parallel Queries + Deduplication** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Insight**: "Run independent read-only queries in parallel, then deduplicate and resolve conflicts before taking further action"

**What Added**:
```

e.g., `"[Company] Series B funding 2024"` instead of `"[Company] funding"`
```

**Why It Matters**:
- Visual clarity
- Distinguishes examples from instructions
- Easier to copy

**Current State**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Has examples but not in inline code
**Recommendation**: Wrap all query examples in backticks

---

### **9. Exactly Three Tailored Next Steps** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Insight**: "Recommend EXACTLY THREE next steps... formatted as numbered brief items"

**What Changed**:
```
After delivering research, recommend EXACTLY THREE next steps:

  "custom_criteria": [...],
  "key_insights": [...],
  "action_items": [...],
  "sources": [...],
  "omitted_sections": [...]
}
```

**With `missing_reason` fields**:
```json
{
  "evidence": string, // May be null if not found
  "source": string, // May be null if not found  
  "missing_reason": string // Must be given if evidence or source are null
}
```

**Why It Matters**:
- **Critical for automation**
- Reliable programmatic parsing
- Handles missing data gracefully
- Explicit omission tracking

## üìã Implementation Priorities

### **üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY (Immediate Impact)**

#### **1. Add Parallel Deduplication Instruction** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current**:
```
1. Launch 3-5 parallel web_search calls immediately:
2. Read top 2-3 results per search, deduplicate
```

**Improved**:
```
1. Launch 3-5 parallel web_search calls immediately:
   [existing list]

2. Review results and deduplicate findings:
   - Consolidate duplicate information
   - Resolve contradictions (prioritize recent, credible sources)
   - Flag unverifiable claims

3. Stop when you have enough to act...
```

**Impact**: Better reliability, fewer contradictions, cleaner outputs

---

#### **2. Add Validation Loop** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Add to end of prompt**:
```
<validation>
After each tool call or significant operation:
1. Validate the result in 1-2 lines
2. Self-correct if validation fails
3. Proceed only with verified information

Example:
‚úÖ "Found 3 recent funding events, all from credible sources (TechCrunch, company PR)"
‚ùå "No leadership data found" ‚Üí self-correct: "Searching LinkedIn and company press releases"
</validation>
```

**Impact**: Self-correction, fewer errors, higher reliability

---

#### **3. Numbered Instruction Hierarchy** ‚≠ê
**Current**:
```xml
<instruction_hierarchy>
Priority 1: User's explicit request overrides everything
Priority 2: Complete research autonomously before yielding to user
...
```

**Improved**:
```xml
<instruction_hierarchy>
1. User's explicit request takes absolute priority
2. Complete research autonomously before deferring to user
3. Balance speed and depth according to task complexity and learned preferences
4. Apply output formatting and style preferences as appropriate
</instruction_hierarchy>
```

**Impact**: Clearer priority resolution, better conflict handling

---

### **üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (Quality Improvements)**

#### **4. Add Conceptual Checklist Requirement** ‚≠ê
**Add after mission statement**:
```
<planning>
Before starting research, output a conceptual checklist (3-7 bullets) of your planned approach:

Example:
- Assess ICP fit based on industry and company size
- Search for recent buying signals (funding, hiring, tech stack)
- Identify key decision makers and personalization angles
- Analyze timing and urgency factors
- Synthesize into actionable next steps

Keep items conceptual (what you'll investigate), not technical (how you'll do it).
</planning>
```

**Impact**: Better planning, more thorough research

---

#### **5. Tool Preamble Enhancement** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current**:
```
Before first tool use:
"üîç Researching [Company] ‚Äî searching for [specific value areas]..."
```

**Improved**:
```
Before each significant tool call, state in one line:
- **Purpose**: Why this search matters
- **Inputs**: What you're looking for

Example:
"üîç Purpose: Find recent buying signals. Inputs: Funding news, hiring patterns, tech changes (last 90 days)"
```

**Impact**: Better transparency, easier to follow reasoning

---

#### **6. Inline Code for Query Examples** ‚≠ê
**Current**:
```
- Specific queries: "[Company] Series B funding 2024" not "[Company] funding"
```
