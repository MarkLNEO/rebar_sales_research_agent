# üéØ UAT Compliance Implementation - Preference Learning & Terminology

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: **IMPLEMENTED** ‚úÖ  
**Goal**: Make the agent feel like it's learning and evolving with the user

---

## üåü Overview

This implementation ensures the agent uses the user's **exact terminology** and **learns preferences** over time, creating a sense of symbiosis and personalization as outlined in the UAT Compliance Audit.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Terminology Injection**

**Problem** (from UAT audit line 126-127):
> Preferences are stored but **NOT injected into prompts**

**Solution**: Prompts now dynamically use user's custom terminology

**File**: `/app/api/lib/context.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
prompt += `\n## BUYING SIGNALS\n`;
signals.forEach((s: any) => {
  prompt += `${i + 1}. **${s.signal_type}**\n`;
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
const signalTerm = profile?.signal_terminology || 'Buying Signals';
const watchlistTerm = profile?.watchlist_label || 'Watchlist';

prompt += `\n## ${signalTerm.toUpperCase()}

The user calls these "${signalTerm}" (use this exact term in your responses):

${signals.map((s, i) => `${i + 1}. **${s.signal_type}**
   - User's exact wording: "${s.signal_type}"`).join('\n')}

**CRITICAL**: In your research output, use "${signalTerm}" as the section heading.
`;
```

**Impact**: 
- ‚úÖ Agent uses "Indicators" if user calls them that
- ‚úÖ Agent uses "Triggers" if user prefers that term
- ‚úÖ User feels the agent is learning their language

---

### 2. **Terminology Awareness Section**

**Added to every prompt**:
```typescript
### IMPORTANT: USER'S TERMINOLOGY
The user calls these items by specific names. ALWAYS use their exact terminology:
- Buying Signals ‚Üí "${signalTerm}"
- Custom Criteria ‚Üí "${criteriaTerm}"
- Watchlist ‚Üí "${watchlistTerm}"

When referring to these concepts in your responses, use the user's exact words above. 
This makes your responses feel personalized and shows you're learning their language.
```

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Agent explicitly told to use user's words
- ‚úÖ Creates feeling of personalization
- ‚úÖ Builds trust and rapport

---

### 3. **Watchlist Persistence**

**Problem** (from UAT audit):
> Watchlist items should show even if no signals detected

**Solution**: Mandatory watchlist section in every report

```typescript
prompt += `\n### MANDATORY "${watchlistTerm}" SECTION

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Include a "${watchlistTerm}" section in EVERY research report.

Format:
### ${watchlistTerm}
${signals.map(s => `- **${s.signal_type}**: [‚úÖ Detected | No recent activity]`).join('\n')}

This section MUST appear even if NO ${signalTerm.toLowerCase()} were detected.
`;
```

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ User always sees what's being monitored
- ‚úÖ Uses their custom watchlist label
- ‚úÖ Shows both detected and not-detected items

---

### 4. **Database Schema for Custom Terminology**

**File**: `/supabase/migrations/20250122000000_add_custom_terminology.sql`

**Fields Added**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_profiles 
  ADD COLUMN signal_terminology TEXT DEFAULT 'Buying Signals',
  ADD COLUMN criteria_terminology TEXT DEFAULT 'Custom Criteria',
  ADD COLUMN watchlist_label TEXT DEFAULT 'Watchlist',
  ADD COLUMN show_watchlist_always BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
```

**Purpose**:
- Stores user's preferred terminology
- Defaults to standard terms if not customized
- Allows agent to evolve with user

---

### 5. **Preference Update API**

**File**: `/app/api/preferences/update/route.ts`

**Endpoints**:

**POST /api/preferences/update**
```typescript
// Update custom terminology
{
  "signal_terminology": "Indicators",
  "criteria_terminology": "Qualifiers",
  "watchlist_label": "Monitoring List"
}

// Update learned preferences
{
  "preferences": {
    "coverage.depth": "deep",
    "summary.brevity": "short",
    "tone": "casual"
  }
}
```

**GET /api/preferences/update**
```typescript
// Returns current settings
{
  "terminology": {
    "signals": "Indicators",
    "criteria": "Qualifiers",
    "watchlist": "Monitoring List"
  },
  "preferences": [...],
  "show_watchlist_always": true
}
```

**Purpose**:
- Allows agent to update preferences based on user behavior
- Supports both explicit and implicit learning
- Provides transparency (user can see what's learned)

---

## üîÑ How the Learning Loop Works

### **Step 1: User Defines Terminology (Onboarding)**

During onboarding, when user sets up signals:

```typescript
// Agent asks: "What do you call these in your organization?"
// User responds: "We call them Indicators"

await fetch('/api/preferences/update', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    signal_terminology: "Indicators"
  })
});
```

### **Step 2: Terminology Stored in Database**

```sql
UPDATE user_profiles 
SET signal_terminology = 'Indicators'
WHERE user_id = '...';
```

### **Step 3: Prompt Dynamically Injects Terminology**

```typescript
const signalTerm = profile.signal_terminology; // "Indicators"

prompt += `
## INDICATORS

The user calls these "Indicators" (use this exact term in your responses):
1. **Funding Round** - User's exact wording: "Funding Round"
2. **Leadership Change** - User's exact wording: "Leadership Change"
`;
```

### **Step 4: Agent Uses User's Terminology**

**Research Output**:
```markdown
### Indicators
- **Funding Round**: ‚úÖ Detected - Series B $25M (2 weeks ago)
- **Leadership Change**: No recent activity (last 90 days)
```

### **Step 5: User Feels Understood**

User sees their exact words reflected back ‚Üí feels the agent is learning ‚Üí builds trust

## üéØ Examples of Personalization

### **Example 1: User calls signals "Triggers"**

**Onboarding**:
```
Agent: "What do you call these in your organization?"
User: "We call them Triggers"
```

**Stored**:
```sql
signal_terminology = 'Triggers'
```

**Research Output**:
```markdown
### Triggers
- **Funding Round**: ‚úÖ Detected - Series B announced
- **M&A Activity**: No recent activity (last 180 days)
```

**User Experience**: "The agent speaks my language!"

---

### **Example 2: User calls criteria "Qualifiers"**

**Onboarding**:
```
Agent: "What do you call these qualifying factors?"
User: "We call them Qualifiers"
```

**Stored**:
```sql
criteria_terminology = 'Qualifiers'
```

**Research Output**:
```markdown
### Qualifiers
1. **Has CISO**: ‚úÖ Met - CISO listed on LinkedIn
2. **SOC2 Certified**: ‚ùì Unknown - No public certification found
```

**User Experience**: "It remembers how I talk!"

---

### **Example 3: User prefers "Monitoring List"**

**Onboarding**:
```
Agent: "What should I call the list of items you're watching?"
User: "Call it my Monitoring List"
```

**Stored**:
```sql
watchlist_label = 'Monitoring List'
```

**Research Output**:
```markdown
### Monitoring List
- **Acquisition**: No recent activity (last 90 days)
- **Leadership Change**: ‚úÖ Detected - New CTO hired
```

**User Experience**: "This feels custom-built for me!"

---

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### **Prompt Construction Flow**

1. **Fetch User Profile**:
   ```typescript
   const { profile, signals, customCriteria } = await fetchUserContext(userId);
   ```

2. **Extract Custom Terminology**:
   ```typescript
   const signalTerm = profile.signal_terminology || 'Buying Signals';
   const criteriaTerm = profile.criteria_terminology || 'Custom Criteria';
   const watchlistTerm = profile.watchlist_label || 'Watchlist';
   ```

3. **Build Dynamic Prompt**:
   ```typescript
   prompt += `
   ### USER'S TERMINOLOGY
   - Signals ‚Üí "${signalTerm}"
   - Criteria ‚Üí "${criteriaTerm}"
   - Watchlist ‚Üí "${watchlistTerm}"
   
   ALWAYS use these exact terms in your responses.
   `;
   ```

4. **Inject into Sections**:
   ```typescript
   prompt += `\n## ${signalTerm.toUpperCase()}\n`;
   prompt += `\n## ${criteriaTerm.toUpperCase()}\n`;
   prompt += `\n### ${watchlistTerm}\n`;
   ```

5. **Agent Generates Response**:
   - Uses custom terminology throughout
   - User sees their exact words reflected back

---

## üìà Impact on User Experience

### **Before Implementation**:
```markdown
### Buying Signals
- Funding Round: Detected
- Leadership Change: Not detected

### Custom Criteria
1. Has CISO: Met
2. SOC2 Certified: Unknown
```

**User Feeling**: "Generic, not personalized"

---

### **After Implementation**:
```markdown
### Indicators (your terminology)
- Funding Round: ‚úÖ Detected - Series B $25M
- Leadership Change: No recent activity (last 90 days)

### Qualifiers (your terminology)
1. **Has CISO**: ‚úÖ Met - CISO listed on LinkedIn
2. **SOC2 Certified**: ‚ùì Unknown - No public cert found
```

**User Feeling**: "This agent knows me! It's learning my language!"
