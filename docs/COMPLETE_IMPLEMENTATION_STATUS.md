## 🌟 **The "Magic" Moments**

### **1. Terminology Reflection**
**User Experience**:
- User says: "We call them Indicators"
- Agent stores: `signal_terminology = 'Indicators'`
- Research shows: "### Indicators" (not "Buying Signals")
- **User feels**: "It speaks my language!"

### **2. Watchlist Persistence**
**User Experience**:
- User sets up 3 signals
- Research ALWAYS shows all 3 (detected + not detected)
- Uses custom watchlist label
- **User feels**: "It remembers what I'm watching!"

### **3. Context Continuity**
**User Experience**:
- User: "Tell me more about the CEO"
- Agent: Automatically reuses previous company context
- No need to repeat company name
- **User feels**: "It understands me!"

### **4. Comprehensive Research**
**User Experience**:
- User requests deep research
- Agent uses web_search tool
- Returns Executive Summary + 5-7 key findings + sources
- **User feels**: "This is actually useful!"

- Small change, huge UX impact

### **2. Persistence Creates Trust**
- Watchlist showing "No recent activity" = transparency
- User knows what's being monitored
- Builds confidence in the system

### **3. Comprehensive Prompts Work**
- 200+ line prompt is appropriate for complex tasks
- Model needs detailed instructions
- web_search tool requires explicit guidance

### **4. Test-Fix-Iterate**

- Second attempt with correct API params worked
- Always test immediately after changes

### **5. UAT Requirements Are Gold**
- User feedback was spot-on
- Following UAT closely = success
- Don't skip the details
