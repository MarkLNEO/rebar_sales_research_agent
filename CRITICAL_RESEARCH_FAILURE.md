# ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Research Completely Broken

**Date**: October 22, 2025 12:15 AM  
**Severity**: **CRITICAL - BLOCKING**  
**Status**: Research output is empty/broken

---

## Problem

After implementing comprehensive research prompt and enabling web_search tool, research output is **COMPLETELY EMPTY**:

```
Executive Summary
High Level
â€¢ No high-level summary provided yet.

Key Findings
None found.

Signals
None found.

Recommended Next Actions
None found.
```

---

## What Was Changed

### Change 1: Comprehensive Prompt
**File**: `/app/api/lib/context.ts`
- Replaced thin prompt with comprehensive 200+ line prompt
- Added Executive Summary requirements
- Added tool usage instructions
- Added delivery guardrails
- Added proactive follow-ups

### Change 2: Enable web_search Tool
**File**: `/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts`
- Added `tools: [{ type: 'web_search_preview' }]`
- Added `reasoning_effort: 'medium'`
- Added `verbosity: 'low'`

---

## Possible Root Causes

1. **Prompt too long/complex** - May have confused the model
2. **Tool configuration wrong** - `web_search_preview` may not be correct
3. **API error** - Request may be failing silently
4. **Response parsing broken** - Frontend may not be handling new format
5. **Verbosity too low** - `verbosity: 'low'` may be suppressing output

---

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. âœ… Check server logs for errors
2. âœ… Test with simpler prompt
3. âœ… Remove tool configuration temporarily
4. âœ… Check if old prompt still works
5. âœ… Verify API response format

---

## Rollback Plan

If cannot fix quickly:
1. Revert `/app/api/lib/context.ts` to simple prompt
2. Remove `tools` configuration from API call
3. Test that research works again
4. Incrementally add features back

---

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Check what the API actually returned
2. **URGENT**: Test if removing `verbosity: 'low'` helps
3. **CRITICAL**: Verify prompt isn't too long for API
4. **HIGH**: Check if web_search tool is actually being called

---

## Status

**BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed with other fixes until research works again

**Priority**: FIX THIS FIRST before any other work
